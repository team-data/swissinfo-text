__label__9     the outsized ,  shifting power of the swiss senate - swi swissinfo . ch             the smaller of the two chambers of the swiss parliament is about to undergo a few changes .  about a third of all the senators will not stand for another term in the 2019 elections .  ( keystone )        in view of next year’s parliamentary elections ,  everyone talks about the significance of the house of representatives .  but the most important political ballot will not take place in this first chamber of the swiss parliament – the senate will decide the outcome of the elections . with a mere 46 seats ,  the senate is the swiss parliament’s second chamber ,  reserving two seats for every canton and one for every half-canton .  yet despite its small size ,  the outcome of the 2019 elections will be especially significant – even decisive – in this institution . why ?  firstly ,  some 14 senators have either decided to step down in 2019 or are seriously thinking about it .  in addition ,  the senator who was elected to the cabinet on december 5 will also have to be replaced at the beginning of 2019 . adding this all up ,  one third of the senate may have to be newly elected ,  a new record since the turn of the millennium .  and ,  now more than ever ,  such a scenario would be an opportunity for the second chamber to reach a turning point . mutation of the leftthe number alone is impressive ,  but the distribution of the resignations among the parties is also extraordinary: fully half come from a single party – the conservative right swiss people’s party . and yet ,  even with not all candidates yet announced ,  it seems certain that the left will suffer most losses .  while the social democrats of canton basel city will most likely keep their senate seats ,  it’s widely expected their colleagues in canton aargau will lose a seat . and with all other social democrat seats set to be contentious at the least ,  there are hardly any real chances for the party to win .  at best ,  they will lose one seat next year; at worst ,  they could lose as many as five . this would amount to a decimation ,  bringing to an end the party’s long-term rise in the senate: while in 1991 they held just three seats in the chamber ,  they have grown every year since  ( except for 2007 )  .  they currently constitute the third-strongest party in the senate ,  with just one seat fewer than the radical-liberals and the christian democrats . strong female candidates played a big part in the rise .  however ,  the era of women’s power seems to be over .  all four sitting female social democratic senators are not running in 2019 ,  and for at least three of the four seats ,  male candidates have already been nominated or are in pole position within their party . but the ultimate reason for the decline is the party’s new shift to the left: even though this secures votes in the proportional representation system ,  in the majority system – applied in the senate – it diminishes the chances to link up with another party . this was something the social democrats experienced in the latest cantonal elections ,  when their representatives in cantons including basel country ,  lucerne or schwyz were voted out of local governments . relegated to the back seat as opposed to the house of representative ,  the majority voting system is quite liberal in the senate .  the christian democrats and the radicals remain at the centre of decision-making ,  and when differences occur ,  they join up with the social democrats to form a majority .  the swiss people’s party is denied this option ,  not having enough seats . with centrist and left-wing parties dominant in the senate since 2011 ,  majorities reached by the swiss people’s party and the radicals in the first chamber are often blocked; this dynamic is what’s at stake in 2019 . with their current 12 senators ,  the social democrats manage to have specialists represent them in numerous senate committees; they can also win majorities in the plenary if they agree with the radicals and christian democrats on socio-political questions . heavy losses would thus relegate the social democrats from the driver’s to the back seat . radical offensive“we want to break the centre-left majority in the senate , ” the radical party president petra gössi said recently in an interview .  she reckons the shift to the right that was widely expected post-2015 never completely materialised; though the house of representatives moved in that direction ,  the senate was largely affected . and yet ,  a new book by bern political scientist adrian vatter about the swiss parliament shows that despite switzerland’s well-balanced two-chamber parliament ,  the smaller chamber clearly has greater weight than the much bigger house  ( 200 seats )  . firstly ,  he reckons ,  the second chamber works more closely with the government than the first ,  which makes it more likely to support proposals submitted by the government .  due to its small size ,  the senate is also more efficient ,  and often ends up having more influence on the general thrust of legislation . finally ,  the small chamber’s negotiations are less polarised .  at the end of the day ,  politicians want solutions that take into account the concerns of both sides . the new versions of the rejected corporate tax reform and the revision of the state pension system have been drafted by the senate .  and though the radicals and the christian democratic party laid the foundation ,  they still needed two of the six social democratic senators to reach consensus . my theory is that changes in the senate – namely ,  vacated seats by the social democrats changing the balance of power – will be more sustainable than in the house ,  and that’s exactly where the big 2019 turning point will be .   translated from german by billi bierling ,   swissinfo . ch         sign up for our free newsletters and get the top stories delivered to your inbox .    #mc_embed_signup div . response { margin: 1em 0;

__label__9     russian spying has ‘calmed down’ ,  says swiss foreign minister - swi swissinfo . ch             russian foreign minister sergei lavrov ,  left ,  and his swiss counterpart ignazio cassis ,  right ,  at a press conference following their working lunch in geneva ,  switzerland on november 28 ,  2018 ( © keystone  /  martial trezzini )        “pragmatic” talks ,  including a visit to moscow by the head of the swiss secret service ,  have helped iron out some of the problems stemming from the alleged russian spying in switzerland ,  according to both countries’ foreign ministers .  swiss foreign affairs minister ignazio cassis and his russian counterpart ,  sergei lavrov ,  were all smiles for the press after a working lunch in geneva on wednesday on the margins of the afghanistan ministerial conference at the united nations .  alleged russian spying in switzerland was one of the main items on their menu ,  alongside the political situations in ukraine ,  afghanistan and syria . relations have been strained between the two countries after a series of revelations of alleged spying by russians in switzerland ,  which moscow continues to deny .  swiss authorities believe that two russian spies targeted a swiss chemical weapons testing facility outside the capital ,  bern ,  while prosecutors are also investigating a cyberattack against the offices of the world anti-doping agency  ( wada )  in lausanne .  in september ,  two swiss newspapers also reported that a confidential intelligence report compiled for the swiss government suggested that one in four russian diplomats based in switzerland was a spy .  russia roundly dismissed the claims . + read more about suspected spying on the spiez laboratory+ read about the suspicions of russian spying on wada+ more on the le matin dimanche / sonntagszeitung report about russian spying in geneva ,  the swiss minister said the spying problems had been partly resolved .  “sensitive ,  difficult questions like espionage can be discussed between friends , ” cassis told reporters .  “we were happy to observe that after our meeting in new york ,  the situation became calmer and improved ,  ending delays in the attribution of visas for russian and swiss diplomats . ” the two ministers previously held talks about the spying allegations at the un general assembly in new york on september 25 .  cassis and lavrov agreed that a visit to moscow at the beginning of november by jean-philippe gaudin ,  the director of the swiss federal intelligence service ,  had helped defuse tensions .  “it allowed him to establish contacts with intelligence officials and should allow us to talk directly to them when there are elements that we don’t appreciate in the future , ” said cassis .  nonetheless ,  the swiss minister maintained a firm line in front of the cameras ,  insisting that there is a clear difference between illegal spying and legal intelligence gathering .  “switzerland doesn’t tolerate illegal spying activities , ” he declared .  “spying activities by diplomats is not allowed ,  whether it’s russia or it’s other countries ,  and we need a correct relationship in this regard” .  swiss probe in october ,  the federal council  ( executive body )  gave the green light for the office of the attorney general of switzerland to pursue a criminal probe against two russian citizens suspected of spying on the swiss government-run spiez facility ,  near bern ,  which analyses chemical and biological weapons .  in march 2017 ,  the federal prosecutor’s office had already opened an investigation against two russians suspected of carrying out a cyberattack against the world anti-doping agency’s office in lausanne .  it is thought that these same two men were part of a group of four russians expelled from the netherlands in april 2018 .  the dutch authorities said they had disrupted their attempt to hack into the hague-based organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons  ( opcw )  .  it is claimed that the agents detained by the dutch and expelled to russia were planning to travel on to the spiez laboratory used by the opcw .  the swiss government-run facility analyses chemical and biological weapons ,  including the nerve agent novichok ,  which britain says russia used to try to murder former double-agent sergei skripal in salisbury in march 2018 ,  and suspected poison gas deployed in syria .   protests and denials in protest ,  the swiss foreign affairs ministry summoned the russian ambassador to demand an “immediate end to spy activities on swiss territory” .  in a tit-for-tat response ,  switzerland’s ambassador to moscow was summoned by the russian foreign ministry in september for an explanation over “unfounded accusations” of russian spying .  russia maintains its innocence .  last week ,  its ambassador to switzerland ,  sergei garmonin ,  again denounced swiss accusations of espionage ,  and said that due to lack of evidence ,  and to preserve relations between the two countries ,  the charges should be dropped .  on wednesday ,  lavrov said professional and pragmatic talks were the only way to resolve problems .  but he insisted that “lots of countries accuse russia of all kinds of wrongs but with no facts ,  always with the same ‘highly likely’ approach of theresa may [comments made after the skripal poisoning]” .  “we learnt from mass media that switzerland had concerns about russian activities , ” said lavrov .  “we were very surprised as there is a tradition of friendly talks… but the swiss government didn’t ask for any explanations from the russian government [about the spying] .  someone from the swiss government perhaps simply shared this information with the press .  they were not looking for any kind of clarification but just wanted to spread a scandal in the press . ”       espionage  gru revelations shatter spies’ code of silence        swissinfo . ch / sb

__label__2     the art of publishing art books ,  independently - swi swissinfo . ch             a rising star in the independent scene ,  nicolas polli won this year ' s swiss grand award for design .  originally from ticino and working in lausanne ,  he is one of 80 publishers taking part of volumes zurich - the annual art publishing fair that has already become a fixture in the city ' s cultural calendar .    ( swissinfo . ch )        a zurich art publishing fair is proving the printed book isn’t dead .  the “volumes” event is more popular than ever ,  attracting publishers from the world over .  switzerland has a long tradition in independent publishing .  in the early modern age ,  many scholars and artists ,  such as erasmus von rotterdam and albrecht dürer ,  would come to basel to print their works ,  considered offensive by the catholic church .  with the reformation ,  after the 1520s ,  protestants ,  anabaptists and other anti-clerical authors also sought refuge in the swiss city attracted also by its printing presses .  they were eventually followed by anarchists ,  socialists and revolutionaries from further afield .        introducing the independent publishing scene in switzerland to the los angeles book fair  ( usa )  ,  volumes produced a booklet with walfisch studio ,  in the format of a mountain .   ( swissinfo . ch )        today ' s independent publishing market has very little to do with politics or religion .  rather ,  it is a niche increasingly explored by visual artists ,  with or without renown ,  as well as for designers who work this medium as an art form in its own right . “independent publishing is not just about self-publishing , ” remarks anne-laure franchette ,  who runs volumes together with patrizia mazzei ,  an arts educator ,  and the editor gloria wismer .  “at volumes we welcome zines and artists’ books ,  but also small publishers ,  indie magazines ,  poetry collectives and performance artists who deal with publishing , ” she says . the fair ' s international scope is also expanding ,  but cautiously .  bookstalls are not organised by country ,  nor are all continents represented .  that said ,  most of europe is represented ,  including turkey and a couple of japanese publishers .  this year the spotlight is on chile ,  with chileans from the book fair impresionante ,  whose presentation comes under the motto "sin ninguna vergüenza"  ( without any shame )  .         anne-laure franchette  ( left )  and patrizia mazzei  ( carlo pisani )        the organisers say that the fair ' s success has paid off with requests from big swiss publishers ,  and they were suddenly faced with a dilemma .  "we didn’t want to close the door to them ,  but on the other hand ,  we have to remain a platform for people who really need it” .  franchette emphasises that volumes includes zurich in its name ,  which is a clear expression of their intention to - first of all - serve as a window for all publishers in the city . established names and new-comersthe art of art publishing is already established in zurich .  patrick frey was a young art critic when he decided to publish the works of his artist friends .  starting in 1986 ,  it was  a small ,  unambitious operation .  more than three decades later ,  edition patrick frey is a well known ,  international brand ,  with almost 300 publications in its portfolio ,  and international distribution . however ,  frey still runs his publishing house independently: being financially secure ,  frey has all the freedom in the world to decide what and how he wants to publish .  in a sense ,  he acts as a curator: each publication has its own format and peculiarities ,  some of them forgoing the inclusion of any kind of text .                            patrick frey      at the other end of the spectrum ,  nicolas polli represents a new generation of independent designers / photographers .  they are digital natives who use the print medium to advance enduring artistic positions .  born in the italian-speaking canton of ticino but now living at the other end of the country in french-speaking lausanne ,  polli took this year’s swiss grand award for design for his yet magazine  ( photography ,  edited with salvatore vitale )  .  he has an unambiguous passion for the physicality of the book form . with “ferox – the forgotten archives 1976-2010” ,  polli breaks the boundaries in his first authorial book between reality and fiction through a  made-up visual research of space imagery: what looks like rocket science is simply an aesthetic exploration .  an image of a far-off planet is actually an extreme close-up of a potato ,  for instance .                            nicolas polli      does the success of volumes serve as evidence of a resurgence of the printed book among digital natives ?  “from our point of view , ” says franchette ,  “this new-found attraction to the physical comes from the perception that everything has become digital ,  and people miss  ' real life '  objects to exchange” .  however ,  mazzei of volumes disagrees with polli when he says that “the word in print is dead” . “nothing is dead” ,  she says ,  “even though it’s clear that some practices are not so popular any more ,  such as zines that have become blogs" . notwithstanding differences of practices or generations ,  volumes is evidence that the independent publishing scene enjoys new freedoms brought by digital tools ,  but artists still value the physicality of books ,  and of personal contact .    volumesthis weekend the kunsthalle zurich hosts the 6th edition of volumes .  this year ,  the fair counts over 100 participants ,  from switzerland ,  europe ,  and - for the first time - overseas . from the archivevolumes keeps records of all the publications on show in the event ,  dedicating a separate space for an exhibition of a curated sample of works ,  such as these examples below:       anissa nussbaumer ' s "i am an artist" .  ( swissinfo . ch )               "im präsens gedichtet"  ( "poemed  ( sic )  in the present" ,  in free translation )  is an anthology of poetry and slam by the von uns collective .  the word in print is not dead ,  and comes alive when staged in public: this year the members of von uns will perform some of their poetry live at the fair .  ( swissinfo . ch )               olivia heussler ' s "zürich sommer 1980" is a photographic narrative of the students riots that shook the whole country .  it is part of volumes '  "zürich archive" ,  a collection of independent publications  on the history and arts of the city .   ( swissinfo . ch )               volumes is also a showcase for inventive formats ,  from the small and cheap ,  such as risographed zines ,  to more sophisticated ,  unusual pieces: in 1996 esther eppstein opened ‘message salon’ ,  an independently artist-run space for experimental practices and ideas .  in the following years ,  and in different locations ,  it became an important meeting point and platform for the local art scene .  the book in the picture covers the first moment of the project ,  published in 1998 by andreas züst verlag ,  with a vhs tape registering the actions that took place in the years 1996 / 97 .

__label__1     abb chief ulrich spiesshofer under pressure to reinvent group - swi swissinfo . ch             spiesshofer cannot hide the fact that revenues have been flat in recent years .   ( keystone )        the strange and cumbersome corporate beast that is the industrial conglomerate must adapt — or die . in the us ,  general electric’s share price has collapsed since its troubled power equipment division slumped to a loss and concerns grew about its financial health . in switzerland ,  speculation swirls over zurich-based abb ,  which is in talks with japan’s hitachi about divesting all or part of its power-grids division . in the limelight is ulrich spiesshofer ,  abb’s germany-born boss since 2013 .  a company veteran ,  he transformed abb’s robotics division ,  which is now its fastest growing unit . as chief executive he has cut costs and focused the group ,  which has annual sales of $34 billion ,  around four pillars: industrial automation and electrification ,  as well as robotics and power grids . yet abb continues to underwhelm investors .  its share price has fallen 20 per cent over the past year ,  compared with 13 per cent at german rival siemens .   ( ge is down 55 per cent )  . two years ago ,  spiesshofer resisted calls for a break-up from cevian capital ,  the european activist investor which holds a 5 per cent stake .  more recently ,  his mind appears to have changed .     div . edged { padding-bottom: 0 ! important; }    news about a possible sale of the power-grid division initially lifted abb’s share price; investors prefer simpler companies doing fewer things . that might appear to be further evidence of the weaknesses of a conglomerate model ,  but abb’s actions could also demonstrate the opposite: that the species can adapt and make itself fit for the future . the case against conglomerates is that market efficiencies are greater when shareholders select their own portfolio mix . the argument for conglomerates is ,  partly ,  that bringing businesses under one roof creates synergies ,  such as through sharing clients or supply chains .  it is also that experienced managers are better at knowing whether ,  when and how to reshuffle portfolios . despite their slovenly reputation ,  industrial conglomerates can be surprisingly agile .  my favourite example is mannesmann ,  the german steel pipe manufacturer ,  which in the late 1990s transformed itself into a telecoms company — and was then bought by the uk’s vodafone for £112 billion . currently ,  portfolio management is in full swing at the world’s biggest conglomerates .  ge is shedding businesses in a frantic attempt to raise cash and refocus . in a more orderly fashion ,  siemens is overhauling its ailing power and gas unit while awaiting regulatory approval for a railway merger with france’s alstom . at abb ,  action is clearly needed ,  despite avoiding ge’s biggest pitfalls .  it exited the power generation sector ,  which is waylaying ge and siemens ,  in 2000 . unlike ge ,  abb has not moved into financial services .  nor has it obviously overpaid significantly for recent acquisitions or fallen victim to management hubris .  “ge are great at marketing — they are also great at bullshitting , ” said one swiss-company watcher . but spiesshofer has failed to return abb to the sustained growth needed to secure his job as chief executive . under him ,  the swiss group has earned a reputation for promising a turning point — only to then disappoint .  revenues have been broadly flat over the past four years as spiesshofer has chopped out less profitable bits of the business . spinning off the power-grid division — or ideas for a more radical abb break-up that have been floated by some analysts — would not solve that strategic challenge directly . spiesshofer has previously cited the costs of carving out the power-grid unit .  industrial infrastructure companies also need global clout in markets . james stettler ,  analyst at barclays ,  said: “i worry about infrastructure businesses [such as power grids] which are exposed to china — because china is becoming an increasingly powerful competitor .  if a buyer came along ,  great — if not ,  would it really be better outside abb ? ”nevertheless ,  a portfolio reshuffle could see abb’s shares trading nearer the higher multiples of “purer” industrial companies . a portfolio shake-up would also be a chance to strengthen abb in the growth markets of the future — using the proceeds ,  for instance ,  to fund a big push into artificial intelligence . abb watchers also see a need to invest more in marketing; abb’s conservative approach to salesmanship stands in contrast with ge’s chutzpah .  to survive in the jungle ,  a threatened beast has sometimes to make a leap . copyright the financial times limited 2018         sign up for our free newsletters and get the top stories delivered to your inbox .    #mc_embed_signup div . response { margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em  . 5em  . 5em 0; font-weight: bold; float: left; top: -1 . 5em; z-index: 1; width: 80%;} label { display: inline; }    / * add your own mailchimp form style overrides in your site stylesheet or in this style block .  we recommend moving this block and the preceding css link to the head of your html file .  * /       email address     top stories  ( weekly )  latest news  ( daily )  business  ( weekly )  politics  ( weekly )  society  ( weekly )  fintech  ( biweekly )  multinationals  ( biweekly )  click here to see more newsletters              ( function ( $ )  {window . fnames = new array (  ) ; window . ftypes = new array (  ) ;fnames[0]= ' email ' ;ftypes[0]= ' email ' ;fnames[1]= ' fname ' ;ftypes[1]= ' text ' ;fnames[2]= ' lname ' ;ftypes[2]= ' text ' ;} ( jquery )  ) ;var $mcj = jquery . noconflict ( true ) ;      
__label__10     country kids outperform city kids on motor skills - swi swissinfo . ch             a somersault towards success - movement is key for pre-schoolers ( courtesy mobak-kg )        the more children move ,  the better they are at balancing ,  rolling and catching a ball ,  a pioneering swiss study has found .  this is especially clear when you compare children growing up in the country to those in the city – and there are differences between boys and girls too . this is the first study to investigate the differences in motor skills among pre-schoolers in switzerland – motor skills being a key part of the early development of children – the authors said .  the results have been published online in the journal swiss sports & exercise medicine . using a newly developed test instrument called mobak-kg ,  researchers compared the motor skills of around 400 four-to-six-year-old children ,  looking at how they moved on their own and how they dealt with an object ,  like a ball .  taking part were 12 kindergarten classes in the more rural canton of uri ,  and 14 kindergarten classes in the city of zurich . “the first results show that clear differences between the sexes are already apparent even at kindergarten age , ” said the university of basel’s christian herrmann ,  who was involved in the study ,  along with colleagues from the zurich and schwyz university of teacher education . he explained that boys do better when in contact with a ball  ( involving object movement ,  like throwing ,  catching ,  bouncing or dribbling )  whereas girls were better able to control their bodies  ( involving self-movement ,  like balancing ,  rolling ,  jumping and running .     balancieren_mobak-kg from mobak on vimeo .  courtesy mobak-kg    the difference may well have to do with parents concentrating on ball games with boys ,  more so than with girls ,  herrmann explained .  he was surprised by the fact that the difference became apparent at such an early age .     prellen_mobak-kg from mobak on vimeo .  courtesy mobak-kg    town and countryoverall ,  uri kids did better than their zurich city counterparts ,  especially when it came to throwing and catching .  this has to do with country children having more areas in which to play and move around than their city peers ,  the study said . half of the kindergarten classes monitored were those that had signed up to the purzelbaum project ,  an initiative to promote physical activity at school  ( see box )  .  as expected ,  the study found that children in these classes did indeed have better motor skills than those in regular ones . herrmann said that the mobak-kg instrument was intended to be used in kindergarten classes to see where improvements could be made and how best to promote physical activity . among the study’s recommendations are that teaching staff especially encourage girls to have a go at catching and throwing .  “it’s only when girls attain a certain level in ‘object movement’ that they will enjoy playing ball games and perhaps might take them up as a hobby ,  like joining a football club , ” the researcher commented . it was also clear that extra physical activities ,  such as those promoted in purzelbaum sport offerings ,  were worth it ,  he said . but herrmann pointed out that there was an enormous difference in what four and six-year-olds could do physically ,  resulting in a challenge for teaching staff tasked with instructing both age groups . healthy swiss the mobak team is also looking into a comparison of primary school-level motor skills in 13 european countries ,  with the first results expected in spring 2019 . although it is too early to say how switzerland has fared in that study ,  it is possible to say that swiss kindergarten and school children achieved satisfactory levels in motor skills for their age ,  herrmann said .  studies of those age groups have already taken place . children were tested against what they would be expected to achieve according to the curriculum in terms of motor skills .  most reached these goals ,  although 20-30% did not .  to explain quite why this is the case ,  would require longer-term studies ,  but other research has found lack of physical activities or different parenting styles to be factors ,  said the researcher . swiss kids seem to have fairly healthy lifestyles overall .  a world health organization  ( who )  report ,  published in 2017 ,  found that obesity was less common in swiss children than in certain other parts of the world .  a who spokesman quoted healthy foods in schools and opportunities for physical activity as some of the reasons . it is very common for children to walk to school ,  especially in the german-speaking part of switzerland .  this can happen from kindergarten age onwards .        world obesity day  obesity less common among swiss kids        swissinfo . ch         sign up for our free newsletters and get the top stories delivered to your
