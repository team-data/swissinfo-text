__label__11     study examines health of geneva’s undocumented migrants - swi swissinfo . ch             around 2 , 000 long-term undocumented migrants in geneva look set to receive official resident permits when the canton ' s "operation papyrus" concludes at the end of this year ( © keystone  /  salvatore di nolfi )        little by little ,  geneva is discovering more about the thousands of undocumented immigrants thought to be in the region .  the initial results of a four-year study into the health and living conditions of illegal and regularised migrants have some important early findings .  around 76 , 000 illegal immigrants are believed to be living in switzerland  ( see infobox below )  .  of these ,  canton geneva is home to 13 , 000 .  in 2015 ,  the local and federal authorities launched a unique pilot scheme ,  known as operation papyrus ,  that looks set to grant around 2 , 000 long-term undocumented migrants in geneva official resident permits when it concludes at the end of this year .  in parallel to the launch of papyrus ,  a team of researchers ,  led by the university of geneva ,  initiated a four-year study into the living conditions of illegal immigrants in geneva and the impact of the regularisation process .  they interviewed 450 undocumented migrants – 300 of whom benefited from the papyrus scheme .  one year into the project ,  the team presented several initial results last month .  they found that 38% of illegal migrants refuse to seek health care due to the high costs ,  compared to 14% of swiss residents and 22% of those who benefited from the papyrus scheme .  among illegal migrants who had no basic health insurance ,  chronic illnesses were more present .  mental health problems were also more common ,  and signs of depression were identified among 60% of those questioned .  “poor mental health due to exposure to different sources of stress is worrying , ” parchemins study co-author and geneva university hospital doctor yves jackson told the tribune de genève newspaper .  “depression and anxiety are often of secondary concern ,  but they have a very clear impact on quality of life . ” the findings revealed more about people’s employment and financial situations .  they confirmed that the market for domestic workers appeared to regulate the flow of illegal workers to geneva .  most were women responding to the local market’s demand for domestic help .  average monthly salaries varied from chf1 , 600-2 , 800  ( $1 , 607-2 , 813 ) ; the amounts were higher for those who had been regularised or had filed an application .  what happens after papyrus ?  while the university study ,  funded by the swiss national science foundation ,  is set to continue over the next few years ,  all eyes are on the papyrus project .  the pilot scheme is due to end this year ,  and the authorities are expected to make an evaluation and official announcement in the coming weeks .  but there is great uncertainty about what comes next and the situation for future requests for regularisation in geneva .  “we have great hope that something will continue and there are signs ,  but much depends on the new justice minister [karin keller-sutter] in bern , ” said remy kammermann ,  a lawyer with the protestant social centre .  geneva has gone much further than other swiss regions in assisting sans papiers .  but there have been important developments in a few cantons .  last month ,  zurich’s city parliament voted to introduce identity cards for all residents ,  including those who are in the country illegally .  the city council ,  which had opposed the idea ,  now has two years to draft a bill to this effect .   the so-called “züri city card” would allow residents to identify themselves to the authorities ,  in particular the police .  supporters also want the card to allow holders access to public and private services without fear of arrest ,  as is done in new york .  other cities ,  like the swiss capital bern ,  are also considering introducing a similar “city card” .  meanwhile ,  sunday’s il caffe newspaper reported that in the italian-speaking canton of ticino a cantonal directive issued in august requires health professionals working for the cantonal health body  ( eoc )  to “systematically indicate to the authorities any individuals without documentation ,  presumed to be asylum seekers ,  foreigners in transit or suspects who arrive at emergency wards alone or by ambulance” .  cristina oberholzer casartelli ,  director of the office for social support and integration ,  which is behind the measure – unique to ticino – told le temps newspaper on monday that it did not wish to interfere in medical activities ,  but that the instruction was for administrative and accounting purposes to “facilitate the issuing of bills for health services provided by eoc” .  however ,  local doctors and health officials have expressed serious concerns about the aims of the directive ,  stating that a doctor’s role is to look after patients and not to denounce those who may be illegal immigrants .  national censusthe most recent comprehensive study by the state secretariat for migration found that in 2015 there were 76 , 000 undocumented migrants in switzerland ,  of whom 12% were minors .  almost half are believed to reside in four cantons: zurich  ( 28 , 000 )  ,  fribourg  ( 20 , 000 )  ,  geneva  ( 13 , 000 )  and vaud  ( 12 , 000 )  .  in all ,  43% were from latin america ,  mostly ecuador ,  bolivia and brazil .  some 24% came from european countries outside the european union and the european free trade area  ( efta )  ,  including many from the former yugoslavia .  others came from africa  ( 19% )  and asia  ( 11% )  .  most undocumented migrants work in domestic jobs ,  construction ,  hospitality and agriculture .  the study showed that 19% of them had lived in switzerland for over ten years ,  35% for five to ten years ,  25% for less than five years and 21% for less than a year .          operation papyrus  a new life for 1 , 000 illegal immigrants in geneva              sign up for our free newsletters and get the top stories delivered to your inbox .    #mc_embed_signup div . response { margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em  . 5em  . 5em 0; font-weight: bold; float: left; top: -1 . 5em; z-index: 1; width: 80%;} label { display: inline; }    / * add your own mailchimp form style overrides in your site stylesheet or in this style block .  we recommend moving this block and the preceding css link to the head of your html file .  * /       email address     top stories  ( weekly )  latest news  ( daily )  business  ( weekly )  politics  ( weekly )  society  ( weekly )  fintech  ( biweekly )  multinationals  ( biweekly )  click here to see more newsletters              ( function ( $ )  {window . fnames = new array (  ) ; window . ftypes = new array (  ) ;fnames[0]= ' email ' ;ftypes[0]= ' email ' ;fnames[1]= ' fname ' ;ftypes[1]= ' text ' ;fnames[2]= ' lname ' ;ftypes[2]= ' text ' ;} ( jquery )  ) ;var $mcj = jquery . noconflict ( true ) ;      
__label__10     how scientists are redefining success - swi swissinfo . ch              ( keystone )        university rankings ,  journal impact factor ,  citation counts: some argue that these methods of measuring the  ' best '  science are outdated and even a hindrance to scientific progress .  switzerland wants to help implement alternatives – a task easier said than done . according to a recent report by the swiss sci­ence council  ( ssc )  ,  scientific activities – whether it’s the employment of researchers ,  the publication of papers ,  or public and private investment – have grown significantly in recent decades .  this growth ,  in turn ,  has resulted in unprecedented levels of competition when it comes to funding ,  prizes ,  academic positions ,  spots in top journals ,  and other trappings of scientific success . with the increased pressure to “publish or perish” ,  more and more importance has been placed on quantitative measures of scientific success [see box] – often focused on publication citations and journal impact factor – which can boost researchers’ incentive to publish even more . common science metrics ,  explainedh-index: a standardised numerical rating that is calculated using the number of scientific papers a researcher has published and the number of times those papers have been cited .  although the h-index aims to express both a scientist’s productivity and impact in his or her field ,  critics say that it is overly simplistic and can’t be compared across areas of science . journal impact factor  ( jif ) : used to rank scientific journals by their importance to their respective fields .  a jif is calculated based on the average number of times a journal’s published papers of the preceding two years have been cited .  the jif is a simple comparison method ,  but it has flaws: it does not directly assess article quality ,  can’t always be compared across fields ,  and can be skewed by a few highly cited articles . university rankings: can be based on knowledge transfer and citations as well as teaching performance .  as more universities and research institutions have started vying for access to funds ,  scientists and students ,  global rankings have become an increasingly useful tool for assessing quality and impact at these organisations .  but some argue that rankings can create incentives for institutions to focus too much on high-impact research to boost their ranking ,  and too little on educational and social responsibilities . it is ,  as swiss academy of sciences  ( scnat )  president antonio loprieno put it at a recent conference in bern ,  a “paradox” of modern science . “on the one hand ,  use of contemporary measures of scientific performance has increased exponentially together with the increase in science funding ,  which is for us a very good thing .  on the other hand ,  we entertain reservations about their fairness ,  validity or applicability , ” he said . to address some of these reservations ,  the ssc this year produced a number of recommendations  ( pdf )  for the swiss science community to change the way it evaluates and funds research – notably by using qualitative indicators to support  ( but not replace )  quantitative ones . “in recent years [quantitative] indicators have been used increasingly as a substitute for qualitative evaluation ,  a practice that has given researchers wrong incentives and threatened scientific quality , ” the report said . “a national strategy taking into account the diversity of disciplinary and institutional requirements for a differentiated evaluation should be promoted . ”more than a numberoveremphasis on quantitative metrics ,  critics say ,  leads to a deterioration of the scientific rigour that these metrics were intended to support in the first place – not to mention tremendous stress for scientists themselves . “according to google ,  my h-index is 48 ,  which means that i have 48 papers that have at least 48 citations .  i don ' t like being reduced by a single number ,  but there are people on this planet who think of me in terms of a single number , ” said stephen curry ,  professor of structural biology at imperial college london ,  who also spoke at the bern conference . “you can use numbers to characterise some aspects of it ,  but science is fundamentally a deeply human activity .  one cannot simply measure the excellence of science; it has to be a matter of judgment ,  discussion and expert input . ”curry leads the steering committee of the san francisco declaration on research assessment  ( dora )  ,  one of several recent efforts to re-evaluate how science is ,  well ,  evaluated; and identify new guidelines for assessing researchers and institutions in a more holistic way that is still efficient enough to keep science moving forward .        shangai ranking  eth zurich again makes top 20 universities worldwide     quantifying qualitycritics also argue that quantitative indicators like the h-index are prone to distortion ,  and not transparent enough in how they’re calculated and used .  these metrics discourage diverse and high risk ,  high-return research in favour of conformism and uniformity ,  they say . for ellen hazelkorn ,  head of the higher education policy research unit at the dublin institute of technology ,  these kinds of metrics are especially problematic at a time when science is for everyone; not just the elite few in their ivory towers . “once research is seen to have a value and impact beyond the academy ,  it ' s no longer the pursuit of individual ,  intellectual curiosity ,  but balanced by social and national priorities , ” hazelkorn said . she added that metrics like institutional rankings – for example the much-anticipated annual times higher education world university rankings – are "hugely unsuited to a high-participation society” because they focus on accountability only within the academic sphere ,  and not to society as a whole . “rankings are simple to understand ,  but their indicators of success increase the levels of inequality and stratification within our societies ,  which in turn have implications for access to public goods . ”simplicity is also a big part of the appeal of individual and journal-level metrics like citation counts and impact factor ,  curry said .  “metrics are easy to calculate; they have a pseudo-objectivity ,  which is appealing to us ,  and they make our lives easier . ”pressure and prestigebut at what cost ?  as curry explained ,  focusing too much on these tools can even slow down scientific progress by encouraging researchers to submit their work to the most prestigious journal possible ,  raising the likelihood of rejection or even retraction ,  the latter of which can also erode public trust in science . additionally ,  a narrowing of scientific focus to publications and prestige means that other important activities are undervalued and may suffer as a result – whether it’s teaching ,  communication and outreach ,  or mentoring of younger scientists . today ,  dora has been signed by nearly 14 , 000 individuals and organisations .  the 2015 leiden manifesto has also gained traction in the academic community .  both documents call for reducing reliance on quantitative metrics like citations and impact factor ,  or at least using them in combination with other ,  qualitative methods that focus on scientific content . emerging alternativesscience is still growing fast ,  and everyone wants to be excellent .  so ,  when it comes to the reality of doing science ,  how can more holistic – but possibly more time-consuming – evaluation methods overcome the allure of ‘quick and dirty’ metrics ? for sarah de rijcke ,  deputy director of the centre for science and technology studies  ( cwts )  at leiden university in the netherlands – the birthplace of the leiden manifesto – one answer lies in what she calls a “portfolio approach” to evaluating science ,  which can be adapted to a given situation ,  institution or researcher . “universal fixes are not very effective , ” de rijcke said ,  because the kinds of research that are most rewarded by traditional evaluation methods vary across disciplines .  instead ,  for a given evaluation context ,  she recommends generic principles for creating a “standardised narrative” that weaves together a scientist’s expertise ,  outputs –  from publications and grants to teaching and even social media – and influences on science and society . the dora committee also collects examples of such approaches on its website; for example ,  asking researchers to summarise their best publications and contributions in their own words using a ‘biosketch’ . stephen curry noted that the move of the global scientific community – also seen in switzerland – toward open access is also likely to be a catalyst for change when it comes to evaluation metrics ,  since open-access journals and pre-print archives may encourage greater emphasis on content and transparency than traditional subscription-based journals . swiss responsibilityloprieno told swissinfo . ch that because of its plentiful funding and flexible administrative requirements compare to other european countries ,  switzerland has an international obligation to push for change . “i think that since we have such a well-funded system ,  we also have a certain responsibility in the rest of the world .  switzerland might experiment or try solutions in a more proactive way to see how to overcome the difficulties of the current system , ” he said . one of the biggest challenges ,  he added ,  will be to ensure that young scientists who are early in their careers are adequately supported during the transition to more diverse science metrics . “my solution would be slightly more tolerance for longer-term research projects .  we tend now to support and finance on a short-term basis ,  which goes in line with this logic of competition .  if we were ready to finance on a longer-term perspective ,  that might take some pressure off the earlier stages in the career and also create a more equal system . ”such a big change in research culture is much more easily said than done ,  as loprieno acknowledged ,  but that doesn’t mean it’s impossible . “this is also a culture we want to revise ,  so we need somehow to start somewhere , ” he said .    swissinfo . ch         sign up for our free newsletters and get the top stories delivered to your inbox .    #mc_embed_signup div . response { margin: 1em 0;

__label__9     cop24: text adopted ,  ambitions abandoned - swi swissinfo . ch             the president of cop24 ,  michal kurtyka of poland ,  officially concluded the summit on saturday .  ( keystone )        representatives of 190 countries attending the cop24 climate summit in katowice accepted the rules for implementing the paris agreement ,  which limits global warming to less than 2˚c .  but to achieve this result ,  it took a lot of negotiation and patience ,  as the delegates of the swiss youth for climate observed .       it is thursday ,  the second week of cop24 ,  and nothing has been happening for hours .  we are waiting in a room far from the crowd .  the negotiators finally snatch a moment of respite and use the opportunity to crash on a sofa or on the floor .  they are recovering from a short night and long day of talks .  suddenly ,  the new texts are published .  the negotiators are waking up .  a murmur runs through the corridors of the conference centre we refer to as the capital .  what margin is there for manoeuvre ?  what are the points that can be conceded ?  which ones are worth fighting for ?  we observe the delegations returning to the negotiation rooms .  unfortunately ,  as civil society observers ,  we do not have access to the action inside ,  but the tension is palpable .  it is 11pm when negotiations resume .  it will be a long night .  .  .  navigating the summitcop24 brings together nearly 20 , 000 participants: delegates ,  ministers ,  journalists ,  civil society observers ,  young and old ,  some dressed in traditional clothes ,  others completely in formal attire .  many events take place simultaneously: plenary negotiations ,  group negotiations ,  bilateral negotiations ,  side events on a variety of topics ranging from social transition to food waste ,  cultural activities at country pavilions ,  meetings among members of civil society or youth representatives .  some of these discussions are open to all stakeholders while others are not or only in a limited way .  it ' s not always easy to find your way around !  the cop is a unique opportunity to learn a great deal about both the conduct and content of international climate negotiations and climate change in general .  it is also an extraordinary meeting place ,  where people from diverse cultures and backgrounds join forces to address the complex issue of climate change .  reliefit is saturday .  a little before 11pm ,  the president ' s gavel falls and the final version of the text is finally adopted .  after two days of waiting and negotiations behind closed doors ,  we are relieved .  except for the points of disagreement that are postponed until next year ,  the manual for the implementation of the paris agreement looks relatively good .  the rules it contains will make it possible to monitor the evolution of countries '  greenhouse gas emissions ,  the measures put in place to reduce them ,  as well as the financial support to be provided or required .  however ,  it is regrettable that there is no reference to human rights and no inclusion of civil society in the monitoring of the implementation of the paris agreement .  it is also disappointing that countries have not taken the opportunity to increase their commitments to reduce emissions and provide financial support for the most vulnerable countries .  indeed ,  the promises made so far to reduce emissions ,  as long as they are kept ,  would lead us to a world at +3°c .  we once again find ourselves in a "business as usual" situation ,  far from the major societal changes necessary to limit the global temperature rise to 1 . 5°c .  founded in 2015 ,  swiss youth for climate is a non-profit organisation that is politically neutral .  its main objective is to give young people a voice in the political debate on climate change .  the organisation is part of the swiss delegation to cop24 in katowice ,  poland . the views expressed in this article are solely those of the authors ,  and do not necessarily reflect the views of swissinfo . ch . opinion seriesswissinfo . ch publishes op-ed articles by contributors writing on a wide range of topics – swiss issues or those that impact switzerland .  the selection of articles presents a diversity of opinions designed to enrich the debate on the issues discussed .          sign up for our free newsletters and get the top stories delivered to your inbox .    #mc_embed_signup div . response { margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em  . 5em  . 5em 0; font-weight: bold; float: left; top: -1 . 5em; z-index: 1; width: 80%;} label { display: inline; }    / * add your own mailchimp form style overrides in your site stylesheet or in this style block .  we recommend moving this block and the preceding css link to the head of your html file .  * /       email address     top stories  ( weekly )  latest news  ( daily )  business  ( weekly )  politics  ( weekly )  society  ( weekly )  fintech  ( biweekly )  multinationals  ( biweekly )  click here to see more newsletters              ( function ( $ )  {window . fnames = new array (  ) ; window . ftypes = new array (  ) ;fnames[0]= ' email ' ;ftypes[0]= ' email ' ;fnames[1]= ' fname ' ;ftypes[1]= ' text ' ;fnames[2]= ' lname ' ;ftypes[2]= ' text ' ;} ( jquery )  ) ;var $mcj = jquery . noconflict ( true ) ;      
__label__7     novartis weighs reinsurance tie-up to fund ultra-expensive drugs - swi swissinfo . ch             could reinsures solve problem of high upfront costs of developing potentially  life-saving treatments ?  ( keystone )        swiss drugmaker novartis is exploring working with the global reinsurance industry to help health systems bear the cost of a new generation of personalised therapies as the industry comes under pressure to devise funding models for ultra-expensive medicines . vas narasimhan ,  chief executive of novartis ,  said the company was “brainstorming” alternative financing possibilities for drugs that offer the prospect of curing patients of once-fatal diseases ,  potentially saving substantial healthcare costs down the line — but requiring enormous upfront outlays . these options could include a “reinsurance model” in which a third party underwrites “the catastrophic case of a child having one of these conditions” ,  narasimhan told the financial times . such deals could prove attractive for the insurance and pharmaceuticals industries .  novartis and other drugmakers are betting increasingly on specialised cell and gene therapies as future growth drivers — despite their eye-wateringly high costs .     div . edged { padding-bottom: 0 ! important; }    for reinsurers ,  which act as a backstop for conventional insurers ,  helping health authorities or governments smooth the cost of such treatments could provide an alternative revenue source .  big reinsurers such as swiss re and germany’s munich re face increasing competition from rival sources of risk capital . reinsurers could make financing easier by pooling the costs of treatments provided by different drug companies and also across countries .  they already provide a backstop to employer health insurance plans and have signalled a willingness to expand into the medical sector . narasimhan said: “i think of it as delivering cures; delivering transformation .  and if we can deliver transformation ,  i have to believe we will find the appropriate value proposition . ”in response to the ebola crisis in west africa ,  the world bank last year teamed with reinsurers to provide cover against future pandemics ,  so outbreaks could be tackled quickly .  swiss re has since the start of the decade worked with roche ,  another swiss drugmaker ,  on financing cancer treatment in china . discussions between drug companies and reinsurers about funding the new generation of therapies — which may require only a single infusion but at large cost — are understood to be at the concept stage but the “reinsurance option” could work for state-funded health systems such as in the uk ,  as well as private insurance based systems . “given that we’ll have five gene therapies in the clinic next year and we plan to continue to have a steady pace of gene therapies ,  we acknowledge we need to work with the system to come up with new solutions , ” added narasimhan . novartis has been among the pioneers of “outcome-based pricing” models ,  through its blood cancer medicine kymriah: 90 per cent of children treated with the drug have not relapsed .  it has offered to waive the $475 , 000 price tag for paediatric use in the us if remission is not achieved within 30 days of treatment but narasimhan conceded that ,  so far ,  take-up had been limited . the company has also developed a gene therapy treatment for spinal muscular atrophy ,  a rare genetic condition that often kills sufferers before the age of two .  clinical trials suggest that ,  four years after a single treatment in the first few months of life ,  children are progressing normally . the 10-year costs ,  borne by healthcare systems ,  of treating such ultra-rare diseases range from $2 million to $5 million ,  according to economic analysis presented by novartis at a recent investor day . narasimhan cautioned that new financing models would only emerge as more new therapies developed .  but “on a 10-year view” ,  he said that if novartis and other drugmakers “can deliver either cures or transformative efficiency ,  i think the system will adapt to allow those kinds of payments over time” . copyright the financial times limited 2018         sign up for our free newsletters and get the top stories delivered to your inbox .    #mc_embed_signup div . response { margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em  . 5em  . 5em 0; font-weight: bold; float: left; top: -1 . 5em; z-index: 1; width: 80%;} label { display: inline; }    / * add your own mailchimp form style overrides in your site stylesheet or in this style block .  we recommend moving this block and the preceding css link to the head of your html file .  * /       email address     top stories  ( weekly )  latest news  ( daily )  business  ( weekly )  politics  ( weekly )  society  ( weekly )  fintech  ( biweekly )  multinationals  ( biweekly )  click here to see more newsletters              ( function ( $ )  {window . fnames = new array (  ) ; window . ftypes = new array (  ) ;fnames[0]= ' email ' ;ftypes[0]= ' email ' ;fnames[1]= ' fname ' ;ftypes[1]= ' text ' ;fnames[2]= ' lname ' ;ftypes[2]= ' text ' ;} ( jquery )  ) ;var $mcj = jquery . noconflict ( true ) ;

__label__9     where swiss development aid meets migration - swi swissinfo . ch             protests against government cuts in tunisia: prospects on the labour market are grim ,  even for the highly educated .  tunisia is also a receiving and transit country for migrants and refugees ( afp )        controversial and currently on hold in switzerland ,  the un migration pact strives to help people live in peace and follow their dreams in their own countries .  but many swiss-supported projects already pursue these goals . earlier this week the international community - but not switzerland - formally adopted an international agreement in morocco that promises a better ,  more coordinated approach to migration .  the swiss government said on friday that it had instructed the federal department of foreign affairs to prepare ,  by the end of 2019 ,  a simple federal decree enabling the swiss parliament to decide whether or not switzerland should sign the pact . the country already supports several key projects in the area of migration .  it has formed five partnerships with bosnia-herzegovina ,  kosovo ,  nigeria ,  serbia ,  sri lanka and tunisia .  the content of a migration partnership is flexible and varies from country to country ,  taking the particular context and the different interests of the partners into account .  apart from the traditional issues of readmission ,  return assistance ,  visa policy and the prevention of human trafficking ,  migration partnerships also link migration with development and include the protection of migrants’ human rights . who ' s involved in the partnerships ? the state secretariat for migration  ( sem )  ,  the swiss agency for development and cooperation  ( sdc )  and the human security division  ( hsd )  in the federal department of foreign affairs  ( fdfa )  are responsible for concluding migration partnerships .  they support the projects financially and with expertise . several of the projects below have been developed as part of a migration partnership .  these and other initiatives supported by switzerland already meet the objectives of the global compact for migration ,  which aims to create conditions that allow people “to live in safety and dignity” and to fulfil their personal ambitions in their own countries .  the compact recognises the global necessity to “optimise the overall benefits of migration ,  while addressing its risks and challenges for individuals and communities” .  it also stipulates that migration takes place according to existing rules and laws ,  and that migrants’ human rights are respected . bosnien-herzegovina: i-platformgeopolitical situation: since the war in the former yugoslavia in the 1990s ,  bosnia-herzegovina has been an ethnically and religiously fragmented country with a complex system of government .  the diaspora in switzerland is very heterogeneous ,  but committed to its homeland .  relations between the diaspora and its country of origin are mostly based on personal relationships .  systematic communication and cooperation with local and national authorities are being established . what are the drivers of migration ?  in the 1960s and 1980s ,  mostly unqualified seasonal workers came to switzerland .  in 1991 ,  switzerland put an end to labour migration from the successor states of the former yugoslavia .  as a result of the war that began in 1991 ,  the number of asylum applications increased ,  peaking at almost 7 , 000 in 1993 .  the federal council then decided to temporarily accept war refugees ,  revoking the decision in 1995 .   after the war ,  national reconciliation remained difficult ,  hampering the return and resettlement of refugees .  since then ,  family reunification and hardship cases have been the main reasons for immigration to switzerland . how many are in switzerland ?  an estimated 60 , 000 people from bosnia-herzegovina live in switzerland .  the majority have a b permit or a c residence permit .  between 1998-2006 ,  the naturalisation rate of bosnian citizens rose ,  but has been declining since 2006how does the fdfa / sem react to the migration drivers ?  the "i-platform" ,  established in partnership with the sdc ,  enables the diaspora in switzerland to contribute to the economic ,  social ,  cultural and democratic development of bosnia-herzegovina .  this ethnically independent ,  nondenominational platform fulfils a dual bridging function: both within the diaspora in switzerland and within bosnia-herzegovina’s fragmented society . sri lanka: safe labour migration programmegeopolitical situation: since the end of the civil war in 2009 ,  the situation in sri lanka remains unstable and is further aggravated by the current political crisis .  switzerland has supported the reform and reconciliation process since the start of the civil war in 1983 .  between 2005 and 2016 ,  switzerland also provided humanitarian aid for reconstruction after the civil war and the 2004 tsunami . what are the drivers of migration ?  several hundred thousand people from sri lanka migrate to the gulf states and to asian countries every year for work .  they work abroad to escape poverty and to improve the chances for better health and education for themselves and their families .  between 2009 and 2018 ,  sri lankan migrant workers sent home an average of more than $500 million  ( chf496 million )  . migrant workers frequently fall victim to unethical recruitment practices and exploitation due to a lack of information and knowledge of their rights .  women are targets of sexual violence or human trafficking .  how many are in switzerland ?  about three million sri lankan citizens live abroad ,  of whom about 50 , 000 live in switzerland .  most of them have fled as a result of the civil war or because of political repression and persecution .  in 2017 ,  840 asylum applications were filed in switzerland by sri lankan citizens  ( about 38% fewer than in the previous year )  . how does the fdfa / sem react to the migration drivers ?  in the international labour organization  ( ilo )  project ,  supported by the sdc ,  migrant workers receive advice and information about their rights to protect them from exploitation .  the project contributes to making labour migration fairer and safer ,  maximising the positive aspects of labour migration and minimising the negative consequences .        better perspectives thanks to professional training: swiss justice minister simonetta sommaruga visits a school co-financed by switzerland in sri lanka ( keystone / patrick huerlimann )        tunisia: fair and ethical recruitment and communauté tunisienne résidente en suissegeopolitical situation: the social ,  political and economic challenges in north africa have remained high since the “arab spring” ,  so too in tunisia .  in recent years ,  tunisia has become both a country of origin for migrants and a recipient and transit country for migrants and refugees . what are the drivers of migration ?  the labour markets in tunisia and the region offer few prospects .  even the well-educated have little chance of finding employment .  youth unemployment is around 29%  ( 2017 )  .  conflicts ,  including in libya and the horn of africa ,  have destabilised the region ,  leading to increased migration to and through tunisia .   how many are in switzerland ?  between 2011 and 2017 some 94 , 000 people left tunisia ,  84% of whom left for europe ,  according to the organisation for economic co-operation and development  ( oecd )  .  in 2018 ,  5 , 000 tunisians had reached the italian coast by october .  by the end of october 2018 ,  262 asylum applications from tunisian citizens were pending in switzerland . how does the fdfa / sem react to the migration drivers ?  these two projects aim to increase the chances of young tunisians on the labour market and improve working conditions in tunisia . the sdc’s ctrs project  ( tunisian community living in switzerland )  ,  which is being implemented in cooperation with the swiss embassy in tunis ,  uses the skills and know-how of the tunisian diaspora in switzerland for the social and economic development of their home country .  projects help ,  for example ,  to give young tunisians the skills they need to find work on the local labour market .  the fair project works to prevent the exploitation of migrant workers and to improve recruitment processes .  the ilo project is being carried out with sdc support in three regions of the world that are particularly affected by labour migration . horn of africa: intergovernmental authority on developmentgeopolitical situation: in the horn of africa ,  seven million people live outside their country of origin ,  representing the worldwide highest concentration of internally displaced people . the countries in this region are among the least developed in the world .  approximately 13 million suffer from food shortages .  violent conflicts ,  attacks by islamist groups such as al-shabaab and cyclical droughts are destabilising this region .        in a camp near the capital mogadishu ,  somalia: women and children who have fled the fighting between the government and the al-shabaab armed group ( afp )        what are the drivers of migration ?  about 70% of the land area in the horn of africa receives less than 600mm of rain per year .  at the same time ,  this region experienced devastating floods in 2018 .  a lack of agricultural land therefore often triggers conflicts and is the reason for persistent poverty . terrorist attacks and high unemployment ,  especially among young people  ( an estimated 60% across the horn )  are further reasons why people seek work outside their country’s borders . how many are in switzerland ?  a good 80% of migrants and refugees from the horn of africa remain on the african continent .  somalis and eritreans ,  however ,  are among the top ten asylum seekers in switzerland .  in 2017 ,  eritreans submitted 3375 applications for asylum  ( 34 . 8% fewer than in 2016 )  .  somalis filed 843 asylum applications  ( down 46 . 7% )  . how does the fdfa / sem react to the migration drivers ?  igad ,  founded in 1996 ,  has eight member states: djibouti ,  eritrea ,  ethiopia ,  kenya ,  somalia ,  southern sudan ,  sudan and uganda .  eritrea has been suspended since 2007 .  igad promotes regional cooperation and helps members to strengthen their national structures to further orderly migration and to protect migrants .  this cooperation also serves to stabilise the region and to counteract the reasons for migration .  discussions to reactivate eritrea’s membership are underway .  this would provide switzerland with the opportunity initiate a migration dialogue with eritrea both within the framework of igad and as part of the existing bilateral dialogue       explainer  why do we need the global compact for migration ?

__label__10     switzerland sets legal foundations for blockchain industry - swi swissinfo . ch             blockchain and crypto tokens have the potential to bring efficiencies and cost savings to a range of industries .  ( dado runic  /  reuters )        the swiss government has announced a wide-ranging blockchain strategy that aims to create a legal foundation for the new technology .  the reports suggests amending existing laws ,  rather than creating new legislation ,  in a bid to enhance switzerland’s status as a blockchain-friendly country . the main focus of the strategy is to incorporate decentralised digital tokens into the swiss business infrastructure ,  particularly the financial sector .  one proposal is to clear away regulatory hurdles for trading securities  ( such as shares ,  bonds or real estate )  on blockchain platforms .  this would create a new regulatory category along the lines of recent fintech laws ,  which allow certain financial activities to be carried out by tech start-ups without a banking license . switzerland has rapidly established itself as one of the world’s leading blockchain hubs ,  attracting both start-ups and hundreds of millions of dollars in investments .  the technology ,  which started off as a means to replace the existing financial infrastructure ,  is now being adopted and adapted by banks ,  stock exchanges and other industries . blockchain / dltblockchain is one example of distributed ledger technology  ( dlt )  ,  a recent digital innovation that allows people to take direct control of their own assets and trade them peer-to-peer without the need for centralised third parties ,  such as banks or other entities . asset ownership and transactions are recorded on encrypted digital ledgers that are open for all participants to both view and validate .  the complete history of asset ownership is included on these ledgers .  to protect privacy ,  participants are assigned “private keys” – a series of randomly generated letters and numbers that act as ids . blockchain was originally designed to be totally decentralised and open to the general public .  but this is not suitable for many businesses that instead opt for restricted dlt platforms that require special permission to access . the swiss government report released on friday describes the innovation as “among the remarkable and potentially promising developments in digitalisation .  it is predicted that these developments have considerable potential for innovation and enhanced efficiency ,  both in the financial sector and in other sectors of the economy . ” digital assetsit also acknowledges that the true potential of blockchain – a form of distributed ledger technology  ( dlt )  - “cannot yet be conclusively estimated” as it has yet to be tested on an industrial scale .  another caveat in the report talks about the risk of cryptocurrencies being used for criminal purposes ,  including the financing of terrorism .  the government said it would remain vigilant but was waiting for the creation of international guidelines before deciding if it needed to take further action . while current swiss regulations cover many forms of digitalisation ,  such as e-banking ,  some aspects of blockchain / dlt technology fall between the cracks in the legal code .  there are two notable challenges to incorporating blockchain into the law . new forms of encrypted digital tokens are not backed by physical assets ,  such as government issued money or paper certificates .  the law needs to be amended to recognise digital-only assets ,  the report suggests . secondly ,  blockchain is designed to bypass middlemen who keep records of transactions and play a recognised role in protecting consumers from fraud .  they are replaced in blockchain by decentralised digital ledgers and smart contract code that automatically processes transactions .  the government wants financial transactions that are performed without physical intermediaries to have a place in the legal code . positive reactionthe report also proposes giving the financial regulator discretion to apply a lighter touch for decentralised blockchain / dlt securities trading platforms ,  provided their activities are not likely to harm investors .  the swiss financial market supervisory authority  ( finma )  currently has these powers when assessing fintech start-ups that offer limited banking services . the creation of such discretionary powers circumvents recent swiss legislation that was inacted to align the swiss financial centre with the european union ,  says luzius meisser of the bitcoin association switzerland .  the law created three categories of stock exchange – none of which are suitable for decentralised token platforms ,  “making it necessary to create a new type in order to allow such exchanges to exist in switzerland , ” meisser says . “this shows once again how the traditional swiss approach of having principle-based laws that give a lot of discretion to citizens and regulatory agencies are much more innovation-friendly than overly detailed european-style laws , ” he said in a written statement . blockchain financial start-ups will soon be able to take advantage of new fintech-friendly regulations allowing firms to take up to chf100 million in client deposits without needing a banking license .  fintechs that qualify under this new regulatory category could also take custody of clients’ crypto tokens up to this value . unlike neighbouring liechtenstein ,  that is in the process of creating a new set of laws aimed specifically at blockchain ,  switzerland has chosen the route of adapting current legislation to incorporate the new technology .  this approach was welcomed by the crypto valley association  ( cva )  ,  which it sees a solid legal base as an essential pillar of switzerland’s blockchain strategy . “we feel that this approach best represents the principle of technological neutrality and is in line with the position taken by the cva in the consultation process , ” mattia rattaggi ,  cva spokesman for regulatory matters ,  said in an emailed statement to swissinfo . ch .  “crucially ,  this approach ensures maximum consistency within the current legal framework while keeping it principle-based and flexible ,  while allowing changes to be adopted on a ‘need-to-regulate’ basis . ”the issue of how to tax digital tokens has been put off until a review is complete at some stage next year .  the federal communications ministry has also been tasked next year with determining how blockchain can be reconciled with data protection laws . proposed law changesamend company bankruptcy laws to recognise data as an asset .  this would allow courts to handle purely digital assets ,  and make sure they go to the right creditor ,  when sorting out insolvent firms . amend the banking act along the same lines as above in the case of a financial institution going bankrupt . amend the scope of the anti-money laundering act to cover decentralised exchanges with the power to dispose of third-party assets . create a “new authorisation category” for blockchain securities traders and exchanges to give finma discretion to apply a lighter touch when assessing the activities of such entities .  amend the financial market infrastructure law and the financial institutions act to “create more flexibility” for blockchain / dlt applications . the finance ministry is already looking into a collective investment schemes act amendment to include a new category of funds  ( limited qualified investment funds l-qifs )  so that “new innovative products could be placed on the market more quickly and cost-effectively in the future” . no immediate changes to financial laws for the insurance industry are immediately foreseen as blockhain / dlt is in its “infancy” in this sector . the report also sees no reason to change any legislation with regards to cryptocurrencies .    swissinfo . ch

__label__11     do we need clinics for internet and sex addicts ?  - swi swissinfo . ch             behavioural addictions may not be so different to drug dependencies .  ( keystone )        one in ten people in switzerland suffers from some form of behavioural addiction: they cannot live without the internet ,  gambling ,  sex or shopping .  an expert from the new centre for dependency disorders in basel gives his view on the issue . hours and hours spent playing on the computer or searching for porn ,  excessive sexual behaviour or the irrepressible impulse to buy - it seems that in many cases ,  the internet and modern society are to blame . + why the who recognised video games addiction as a diseaseto tackle these ‘new’ disorders ,  the basel university psychiatric clinics have opened switzerland’s first clinic specialised in the inpatient treatment of behavioural addictions .  “with this service we are entering a new field , ” says clinic director gerhard wiesbeck . swissinfo . ch: i spend hours watching television and check my mobile phone dozens of times a day .  does this mean i am addicted ? gerhard wiesbeck: we should not confuse a bad habit or passion ,  for instance for dance ,  with an addiction .  repetitive behaviour that gives rise to intense feelings is not necessarily an addiction .  i would add: it is not the mobile phone that makes us dependent ,  but how we use it . swissinfo . ch: how can you tell if it’s a bad habit or an addiction ? g . w . : addiction is an illness .  this summer ,  the world health organization officially recognized gaming addiction as a disease .  the person who has become dependent on gaming is in the grip of excessive behaviour that they can no longer control .  this causes them suffering and has a negative impact on their body ,  mind ,  social life or financial situation . before talking about dependency ,  and therefore a disease ,  we must therefore analyse the consequences of the behaviour: has watching television or looking at your mobile all day caused problems at the workplace ?  have you given up friendships and hobbies ?  have you got into debt ?  do you have suicidal thoughts ?  if some of these criteria are met ,  then we are dealing with a pathological addiction . swissinfo . ch: how many people are affected in switzerland ? g . w . : according to the most conservative estimates ,  1% of the population is addicted to gambling ,  2% to the use of the internet and computers ,  3% to sex and 5% are compulsive shoppers .  in the canton of basel city alone ,  we are talking about at least 19 , 000 people . beyond the numbers ,  though ,  most worrying is the comorbidity or co-existence of multiple illnesses in the one person: 80% of individuals with a behavioural dependency suffer from depression ,  anxiety ,  attention deficit hyperactivity or personality disorders ,  or are dependent on substances such as tobacco ,  drugs or alcohol . swissinfo . ch: can a computer addict be compared to a drug addict ? g . w . : there are many similarities and the criteria defining these addictions are similar .  in both cases ,  the person is suffering and unable to find a way out on their own .  the difference is that ,  in the case of behavioural problems ,  the phenomenon is one of pure dependency: there is no pharmacological effect caused by a substance . swissinfo . ch: there is also another difference: cocaine ,  for instance ,  is relatively expensive and hard to find .  and ,  above all ,  it is illegal ,  unlike the internet .  so are behavioural addictions more dangerous as a result ? g . w . : i would not say more dangerous .  but they are more accessible and available ,  which has repercussions for treating them .  for drug addicts or alcoholics ,  abstinence is a central part of the therapy .  but for someone who is a compulsive shopper or who cannot tear themselves away from the computer ,  this is impossible .  the idea ,  therefore ,  is not complete abstinence from the internet but only from problematic content ,  such as pornographic sites or online games . swissinfo . ch: basel has provided outpatient treatment for people with behavioural addictions since 2010 .  why did you want to open a specialised clinic ? g . w . : since 2010 we have assisted 102 people ,  mainly with gambling problems .  however ,  we realized that for 10% of patients ,  outpatient treatment was not enough .  their addiction was so strong that they had to be removed from their family ,  social and work environment .  on july 1 this year we inaugurated the first clinic for inpatient treatment . swissinfo . ch: how do you treat someone who is addicted to the internet ? g . w . : generally ,  patients come to us not so much because of their addiction ,  but because of the negative consequences that ensue: debts ,  work problems or a relationship breakdown .  the treatment involves individual or group therapy and ,  if necessary ,  medication .  depending on the case ,  we also offer ergotherapy ,  physiotherapy and kinesiotherapy .  a social worker can also help the patient solve debt issues or look for a job . “in the future ,  i fear that the internet and new media will become even more dangerous . ”swissinfo . ch: how long does the treatment last ? g . w . : at least six weeks ,  although for most patients it takes at least ten .  we have 12 beds and the costs are covered by the basic health insurance . swissinfo . ch: is the swiss approach to treating behavioural addictions different ?

__label__9     tale of swiss-based syrian torture survivor highlights dublin flaws - swi swissinfo . ch             jalal did not want to have his identity disclosed out of security concerns for relatives who are still in syria .  ( swissinfo . ch )        jalal last saw his youngest son was when the boy was a baby .  now hamude is almost five .  the asylum seeker from syria is caught up in a complicated international case based on the dublin accord ,  a regulation that switzerland applies more strictly than any other country in europe ,  according to critics .  jalal has been living in limbo ,  unable to plan more than a few months in advance ,  since 2014 . “i spent five years in a syrian prison and now i have spent [almost] another five years in an open prison , ” jalal told swissinfo . ch in november .   the father leads an isolated life in a tiny studio on the outskirts of lucerne in central switzerland . hamude ,  along with his mother and two siblings ,  live equally isolated in a rundown caravan camp a couple thousand kilometres away in greece .  their relationship unfolds largely over whatsapp .  living with no sense of when or where they will all see each other again has both parents on the edge of a nervous breakdown .        jalal ' s family lives in a camp near the greek port city of thessaloniki .   ( swissinfo . ch )        despite the efforts of lawyers in both countries ,  the family has been unable to reunite ,  victims of a dublin accord that member states including switzerland prefer to invoke to expel people rather than evaluate their cases .  under the regulation ,  switzerland can automatically deport individuals to the first country of arrival in the schengen area .  as a kurd ,  who says he suffered torture and prolonged detention in syria as well as a dangerous war wound ,  jalal’s asylum claim warrants evaluation . but jalal faced a classic problem — one confronting asylum-seekers in switzerland and across europe .  the only aspect of his journey the swiss authorities cared about at the time of his arrival was through which country he entered europe’s open borders schengen area ,  not why he was seeking asylum .  on that basis ,  the decision to expel him to italy was made in early 2015 . “switzerland has never lived through a war ,  so the swiss are not able to empathize with people who are fleeing a war , ” concluded jalal in a moment of deep uncertainty about his future .  “if they had any sense of what we have been through they would not deal with us like this . ” switzerland prides itself on its strong humanitarian tradition but policies relating to asylum and migration have hardened in recent years as elsewhere in europe .  the swiss secretariat for migration  ( sem )  declined to comment ,  saying it does not provide details on individual cases for “data protection” reasons .  swiss policyswitzerland ,  the founding country of the red cross ,  is renowned for its humanitarian tradition .  but its asylum policy has become increasingly restrictive over the past decade .  right-wing parties ,  particularly the anti-migrant swiss people’s party ,  have been particularly active in this area .  the people confirmed this trend by agreeing in 2016 to tighten reception conditions for asylum seekers and speed up application procedures .  the accelerated asylum proceedings will come into force in march next year .  since 2015 ,  the state secretariat for migration  ( sem )  has also been stricter in examining asylum applications ,  particularly with eritrean applicants .  this hardening ,  supported by parliament ,  has been fought by organisations representing migrants . a syrian nightmare back in syria ,  in 2004 ,  jalal says he found himself on the wanted list of the syrian regime for participating in a protest demanding greater rights for the kurdish minority population .  he and his father were targeted in a knife attack by pro-regime thugs three years later ,  in 2007 .  jalal incurred 12 cuts while his father was killed on the spot . according to his story ,  kurdish rights activism landed him behind bars .  he was held in a prison in the northern city of aleppo where one of the many grisly tasks assigned to him was cleaning the basement room used for executions — punishment for dodging military service .  he was still behind bars as a popular revolt against syrian president bashar al-assad gave way to large scale massacres and war . he says he eventually managed to escape during a rebel attack on the prison ,  seized the opportunity to flee to turkey and had to return to syria to borrow money to pay smugglers to get his family to europe .  on that journey ,  he sustained a grenade injury .  neither surgeons at the field clinic that treated him that day nor those later in switzerland were able to extract all of the fragments . getting to europebadly wounded ,  he boarded a naval ship from the turkish coastal town of mersin and travelled with hundreds of others to italy .  time in italy was brief but long enough for the authorities to take his fingerprints — an act that would underpin the swiss decision to send him back . “the italian authorities put us on buses and took us straight to the train station in milan ,  so we could continue to europe , ” says jalal ,  who picked switzerland over germany because his two brothers were already living in the alpine nation .   “a return to italy would mean starting from scratch and god knows how many years until i see my wife and children . ”in switzerland ,  he now gets by on emergency aid and found accommodation — a spartan but clean studio — through the caritas charity .  every two weeks he must report to the local migration authorities .  the one thing he is deeply grateful for is the medical and psychological treatment he has received here . navigating swiss and international lawsgabriella tau and boris wijkström are his lawyers at the centre suisse pour la défense des droits de migrants  ( csdm )  ,  an organisation focused on defending the rights of migrants .  csdm took up his case and brought it to the attention the committee against torture  ( cat )  at the united nations ,  which suspended his expulsion pending a ruling on the merits of the case . during an october interview in his small office in geneva ,  where dozens wait in the stairway in the hope of getting legal assistance ,  wijkström said they are “very careful” of which cases they defend .  the lawyers only take up a few per year ,  selecting the ones where they feel there has been a real miscarriage of justice . “they are very sensitive to any possible limitations imposed on dublin expulsions to italy , ” he said about the swiss position on asylum cases that have reached cat . switzerland has a reputation for being a highly efficient user of the dublin system ,  a “blindly”  mechanical efficiency that human rights groups including amnesty international say ride roughshod over the most vulnerable of individuals .  the swiss refugee council wants switzerland to stop sending vulnerable asylum seekers back to italy because “adequate reception is not guaranteed there” . in 2017 ,  switzerland made 2 , 297 transfers invoking the dublin iii regulation to neighbouring italy ,  germany and france and received 885 transfers from those countries ,  according to the council . “switzerland stands out as one of the biggest users of the dublin system ,  even though volumes are ,  for instance ,  much smaller than those of germany , ” notes francesco maiani ,  an expert on european asylum policy and law .  “switzerland is one of the countries that consistently had more transfers to other countries than transfers from other countries . ”however ,  two clauses with the dublin regulation iii actively encourage a softer approach .  one is the sovereignty clause .  the other is the humanitarian clause . dublin regulationthe sovereignty clause located in article 17 ( 1 )  of the dublin regulation gives members states the possibility of examining any application that is lodged with them ,  especially for humanitarian or compassionate reasons . under the “humanitarian clause” found in article 17 ( 2 )  of the dublin regulation ,  member states may agree to transfer responsibility to a state that would not be responsible under the criteria so as to keep or bring him / her together with family relations . the sem told swissinfo . ch it applies the “sovereignty clause” when a transfer “would contravene mandatory provisions of international law or in the presence of humanitarian grounds indicating that a transfer is a particularly rigorous measure . ”it also rejected the notion that it applies the dublin regulation “blindly . ”“the whole ethos of the dublin system is quite problematic , ” said maiani ,  a member of the faculty of law at lausanne university in a phone interview .  “it tends to underscore that if you send asylum applicants away you win the game .  if you admit them ,  you lose the game .  and this of course introduces a lot of distortions in the process . ”in an october letter to un special rapporteur on torture nils melzer ,  csdm outlined its concerns over “the systematic expulsion of torture victims and other vulnerable asylum seekers under the dublin regulation from switzerland to european union countries where dysfunctional asylum systems that expose them to a real risk of inhuman and degrading treatment” . a sem spokesperson explained that switzerland wants to see the dublin iii regulation reformed so that procedures are “faster and more efficient” ,  secondary migration prevented and responsibility between countries distributed more fairly .  “switzerland regularly takes this position at the european level and in bilateral talks with government representatives of eu member states and eu institutions , ” the spokesperson said . not one ,  but two dublin proceedingsfor now ,  jalal’s best shot at family reunification would be a swiss decision to grant him asylum .  but that risks being a lengthy process .  the family got tangled in two dublin proceedings — one to expel jalal from switzerland to italy ,  the other a bid by greece to see the family reunited in switzerland . “sometimes a dublin reunification can take up to two or three years although on paper things should move more quickly , ” notes michael kientzle ,  who works with the refugee aid group in greece that filed a request for switzerland to take charge of jalal’s family .  the request was rejected and is now being appealed . the rest in limbo just like jalal . when asked about the case ,  sem said it takes into account the arguments put forward in decisions made by cat [which recently ruled in favour of an eritrean asylum-seeker and torture survivor presenting similar circumstances . ] “[if sem] concludes that a transfer to a dublin state would endanger a person ,  it will conduct the asylum procedure in switzerland , ” it said . shortly after being contacted by swissinfo . ch ,  sem finally decided to examine his asylum claim .  “the facts of his case have not changed , ” noted wijkström .  “it’s great news for him but it underscores the arbitrariness of the whole system . ”adding to the absurdity of it all ,  he added ,  the lucerne prosecutor has kept open a case against jalal over illegal entry and illegal stay .  arbitrary or not — the decision by authorities to hear him out has filled jalal with a new sense of purpose and hope for a fresh start in switzerland . on the chilly morning of december 12 ,  he met with a caritas lawyer who will join him during his asylum hearing .  he came prepared with all his documents ,  including x-rays and family identification booklet .   “maybe things finally work out and i get to see my family , ”  he tells swissinfo . ch ,  consumed by nerves both about the outcome of his interview and the conditions of his mother and brother struggling to get on in a war-torn pocket of syria . ” all i can do is retell my story .  they already have all the evidence . ”         sign up for our free newsletters and get the top stories delivered to your

__label__1     men appointed to boards because it’s ‘easier’ - swi swissinfo . ch             women are still very underrepresented in swiss company boardrooms ( peter klaunzer  /  keystone )        few women sit on company boards in switzerland - and the rate is low compared to other european countries .  while parliament on tuesday put off deciding about quotas ,  the business world has clear ideas about what should be done . the senate on tuesday threw out a revision of swiss company law ,  that would have included the issue of female quotas for company boards .  it has now gone back to committee stage to be revised . the most important duty of a company board is to oversee top management – and to have a 360-degree view of what should be done .  that’s why members should preferably bring diverse skills and experience to the table ,  says rudolf meyer ,  founding member and honorary present of actares ,  an organisation representing small shareholders that promotes sustainable company policies . but most swiss boards are dominated or are completely made up of men .  there are in fact only 16% women in the boards of the 100 largest swiss companies .  “this is despite the fact that everybody knows that short-term upheavals are less disruptive and that there is more serious decision-making in mixed committees .  also there is a better performance overall , ” meyer said . there are enough qualified women around who meet requirements ,  who would be ready to accept the responsibility and to get involved ,  added meyer . old boys’ clubin some cases ,  the differing ways in which men and women perceive themselves may play a role .  “men are much more prepared to accept several mandates ,  although in many cases you are left wondering how they can possibly manage all these duties .  women are probably in general more cautious and conscientious on this point , ” meyer continued . another ,  more key reason for women’s underrepresentation ,  is that it simply takes more effort to find a woman to sit on a board ,  he argued .  most firms recruit board members themselves and often with minimum effort .  that means getting someone from your wider circle ,  known to you .  and as men usually have a better network than women ,  male board leavers are normally replaced by men . this is also the view of the swissboardforum ,  sbf  ( formerly swiss institute for board members )  lobbies for “the promotion of professional board activities” .  for the sbf ,  the low numbers of women on boards is mostly not down to decisions against women as such ,  but from “a certain laxity or even convenience” . the sbf agrees that the best possible boards are “diversified and a reflection of the company’s challenges ,  market and potential” . but it believes that it’s up to companies to promote women ,  not lawmakers .    if ( "undefined"==typeof window . datawrapper ) window . datawrapper={};window . datawrapper["oopw4"]={} , window . datawrapper["oopw4"] . embeddeltas={"100":771 , "200":571 , "300":478 , "400":461 , "500":444 , "700":407 , "800":407 , "900":407 , "1000":407} , window . datawrapper["oopw4"] . iframe=document . getelementbyid ( "datawrapper-chart-oopw4" )  , window . datawrapper["oopw4"] . iframe . style . height=window . datawrapper["oopw4"] . embeddeltas[math . min ( 1e3 , math . max ( 100*math . floor ( window . datawrapper["oopw4"] . iframe . offsetwidth / 100 )  , 100 )  ) ]+"px" , window . addeventlistener ( "message" , function ( a ) {if ( "undefined" ! =typeof a . data["datawrapper-height"] ) for ( var b in a . data["datawrapper-height"] ) if ( "oopw4"==b ) window . datawrapper["oopw4"] . iframe . style . height=a . data["datawrapper-height"][b]+"px"} ) ;  company responsibility or law ? sbf president silvan felder gives two reasons against using legal measures to boost the number of women representatives on executive boards .  “listed companies are in the spotlight more than ever before .  they can no longer can afford to ignore gender diversity ,  especially for image reasons , ” he said . in addition ,  the swiss code of best practice for corporate governance ,  drawn up by the swiss business federation economiesuisse ,  now requires companies to explain why they do not adhere to the recommended composition for boards  ( including women’s representation )  . however ,  this recommendation does not go as far as the government’s proposal ,  which wants gender quotas in boardrooms of large companies ,  with more than 250 employees ,  enshrined in the code of obligations – that regulates contract law and corporations . firms would have to ensure that 30% of the board of directors and 20% of the executive board is female ,  over the next five and ten years respectively . however ,  the bill stops short of imposing sanctions for companies which fail to implement the quota .  instead ,  it proposes a “comply or explain” regulation as a best practice standard . + read about the background to these gender equality quotasfelder says the guidelines are desirable but if they are put into company law ,  they would be “a further example of regulation-craziness in politics” . shareholder group actares does not agree .  there needs to be a more radical approach to policy ,  it argues .  it welcomes the government’s proposal .  actares honorary president meyer is amazed that opposition to this “flexible solution” is also so strong in parliament ,  because it is not such a significant attack on company freedom as opponents say . the government’s proposal was accepted by a small margin in the house of representatives in june .  but the senate was not happy with the whole packet of measures to revise company law – not just because of the quotas issue – and sent it back to its legal committee on tuesday .  this means that promotion of women in boards is currently stalled on a political level . women onboardin a recent report on swiss public television srf on the issue of women in boardrooms ,  karin lenzlinger ,  who sits on several boards ,  said she was against quotas because she wanted to be asked to take a post due to her experience ,  not to fill a quota . firms seem to be looking for women with board experience ,  rather than for new faces ,  the report found .  esther-mirjam de boer ,  whose company specializes in finding female board members ,  said that women with board experience often receive multiple requests and cannot take all the work on .  for her part ,  lenzlinger said there were enough qualified women around ,  but that they must become more visible .  she did this by taking part in business forums ,  getting involved in politics .    swissinfo . ch         sign up for our free newsletters and get the top stories delivered to your inbox .    #mc_embed_signup div . response { margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em  . 5em  . 5em 0; font-weight: bold; float: left; top: -1 . 5em; z-index: 1; width: 80%;} label { display: inline; }    / * add your own mailchimp form style overrides in your site stylesheet or in this style block .  we recommend moving this block and the preceding css link to the head of your html file .  * /       email address     top stories  ( weekly )  latest news  ( daily )  business  ( weekly )  politics  ( weekly )  society  ( weekly )  fintech  ( biweekly )  multinationals  ( biweekly )  click here to see more newsletters              ( function ( $ )  {window . fnames = new array (  ) ; window . ftypes = new array (  ) ;fnames[0]= ' email ' ;ftypes[0]= ' email ' ;fnames[1]= ' fname ' ;ftypes[1]= ' text ' ;fnames[2]= ' lname ' ;ftypes[2]= ' text ' ;} ( jquery )  ) ;var $mcj = jquery . noconflict ( true ) ;      
__label__9     what now for syria ?  - swi swissinfo . ch             buildings destroyed during the fighting in the northern town of ariha ,  in idlib province ,  syria ( copyright 2018 the associated press .  all rights reserved )        “it is really playing with a gigantic powder keg in the middle of three million civilians” .  these were the words of jan egeland ,  the united nation’s humanitarian advisor for syria ,  on his final day in office last month after chairing his last meeting of the un’s humanitarian task force .  he was talking about idlib ,  the last syrian city still in rebel hands .  the buffer zone created around the city by russia and turkey was starting to fray: there had been artillery and air attacks ,  armed incursions ,  and tension was rising .  idlib ,  many still believe ,  could be the last ,  and possibly bloodiest battle in syria’s long and bloody war .  when aleppo fell ,  and then again when eastern ghouta succumbed ,  many opposition figures and their families escaped to idlib fearing ,  with some justification ,  possible brutal reprisals by the syrian government . now government forces are closing in ,  and idlib is home ,  it’s believed ,  to around 30 , 000 fighters and those three million civilians jan egeland worries about .  and yet egeland ,  who has worked doggedly for the protection of syrian civilians for years ,  has left office .  his boss ,  the un special envoy for syria ,  staffan de mistura ,  will follow him at the end of the month . to many ,  it’s a strange moment to leave: the humanitarian needs in syria remain immense ,  and the war ,  while perhaps quieter ,  is by no means over .        syrian chief negotiator bashar al-jaafari ,  left ,  ambassador of the permanent representative mission of syria to un new york ,  shakes hand with un special envoy of the secretary-general for syria staffan de mistura ,  right ,  during syria peace talks in geneva ,  on march 24 ,  2017 ( © keystone  /  martial trezzini )        un relegated ?  but the fact is for quite some time the future of syria has been determined not in geneva ,  within the framework of a un sponsored peace process ,  but in astana ,  in a rival strategy developed by russia ,  iran and turkey .  that strategy became possible after russia entered the war ,  using its massive air power to back up syrian forces as they retook one rebel-held region after another .  so ,  after seven long years ,  does this mark a failure for the un ?  there have been three un special envoys: kofi annan and lakhdar brahimi left office with little to show for their hard work ,  staffan de mistura stayed longer ,  but is now leaving too . the un invested years of diplomacy ,  there were round after round of negotiations in geneva .  i reported on nearly all of them ,  and looking back now ,  it feels strange to remember how they began with grand diplomatic pomp ,  ceremony and even hope ,  attended by hundreds of journalists ,  and gradually shrank to painstaking attempts by mr de mistura not to achieve peace ,  but to build a structure for a constitutional committee ,  which would at some indeterminate date in the future draft a new constitution for syria . high drama ,  farce ,  and boredom in between ,  we saw talks which veered from high drama to farce to – let’s be honest ,  boredom - at least for me and many journalists .  there were times when one or other delegation said they would come to geneva but then didn’t .  there were times when people stormed out .  they rarely even met in the same room: mr de mistura and his predecessors had to scuttle ,  like weary medieval messengers ,  between them . lakhdar brahimi did once get them into the same room ,  briefly ,  but at a specially shaped table so that they were not required to look each other in the eye . there were sleepless nights while we waited for an ever-delayed press conference .  there were times when the talks shifted from the un palais des nations to the 5-star geneva hotels of the participants .  without fail ,  this tactic happened in winter ,  and journalists would invariably be told by the police to wait outside in the street .  this was confirmation that there had been no progress was then tweeted and texted by fingers numb with cold .        jan egeland ,  special advisor to the un special envoy for syria ( © keystone  /  martial trezzini )        un failure ?  so ,  is syria a failure for the un ?  many would argue yes .  the conflict ,  which started with peaceful demonstrations in one country ,  has lasted longer than the second world war .  millions have been displaced ,  hundreds of thousands killed ,  many regional powers have joined the fight ,  and syria’s great historic cities lie in ruins . but when asked this question ,  jan egeland prefers to see the failure on a wider level .  “i strongly feel we all failed the syrian civilians , ” he told me on that final day in office .  “this war was about letting all hell loose on heavily populated areas full of vulnerable people . ”“first and foremost ,  [i blame] the men with guns and power .  the warring parties on the ground failed their own peoples ,  because they were willing to fight each other to the last civilian . ”“then i would say those who were sponsors ,  those who gave the arms ,  those who fought with the warring parties ,  those who brought fuel to the fire . ” “and then [i blame] all of us who were not able to curb this violence by not getting them to stop . ”       inside geneva  syria: what will it take to make peace ?      so ,  what happens now ?  the un has certainly not given up on syria .  in the last few days aid agencies have appealed for $5 . 5 billion  ( chf5 . 4 billion )  to assist syrian refugees and host countries next year .  because ,  although a trickle has begun to return  ( around 37 , 000 this year )  ,  for most of the 5 . 6 million refugees it is simply not safe to go back yet .  many have no documents to prove ownership of the land or property they left behind ,  many homes are destroyed ,  so too are schools ,  hospitals ,  water and electricity supplies . there will be a new un envoy too ,  norwegian diplomat geir pedersen .  he is sometimes described as a ‘diplomat’s diplomat’ ,  and has extensive experience of the middle east ,  and of complex conflicts . mr pedersen is expected to name a new humanitarian adviser to replace jan egeland: humanitarian support will remain vital in syria for many months ,  probably years .  and until staffan de mistura leaves office he will spend his remaining efforts still working towards that elusive constitutional committee .  it sounds bureaucratic and over complicated ,  but mr de mistura ,  mr pedersen after him ,  and the entire un system ,  have their eyes on peace ,  not the frozen war which russia and its allies have managed to impose across large parts of syria . any experienced diplomat will tell you that a constitution backed by a country’s population is a foundation stone for a sustainable peace .  so too are reconciliation ,  and accountability for war crimes . these are all things the un has huge experience of ,  and it will try to achieve them for syria ,  and its long-suffering civilians .  in the meantime ,  jan egeland warns that the whole world must learn from syria’s conflict .  “we need to learn from this war .  is this how war will be fought in the future ?

__label__6     venezuelan ex-minister hoarded money in switzerland - swi swissinfo . ch             as teachers  ( pictured )  and others protest the crisis in venezuela ,  some former leaders are leading a luxurious lifestyle in the united states – with their money stashed in swiss banks .  ( miguel gutierrez  /  epa  /  keystone )        as the us justice authorities investigate corruption among venezuela’s former leaders ,  there is evidence that embezzled state funds flowed into swiss bank accounts . the investigative newsletter gotham city* ,  which focuses on white-collar crime ,  has traced how the so-called “bolivarian bourgeoisie” – powerful venezuelans with links to the late venezuelan president hugo chavez – diverted more than $1 billion  ( chf995 . 8 )  of public money to finance their opulent lifestyles in the united states . for example ,  alejandro andrade ,  the former chavez bodyguard appointed finance minister in 2007 ,  pleaded guilty to corruption on november 19 .  court documents examined by gotham city show how he and his peers trusted swiss banks to hide money . andrade alone had 17 accounts with nine swiss banks ,  including hsbc ,  julius bär ,  credit suisse ,  compagnie bancaire helvétique in geneva and pkb in lugano ,  gotham city journalists found .  the former venezuelan minister ,  who owned a racehorse ranch in florida ,  was sentenced to ten years in prison .        julius bär is one of the banks where alejandro andrade had deposited some of the wealth he had accumulated under the chavez administration .  ( gian ehrenzeller  /  keystone )        with the admission of guilt ,  all of the former minister’s accounts were frozen and their contents transferred to the american courts .  the confiscated amounts were not disclosed ,  but the former finance minister confessed to accepting tens of millions of dollars in bribes .  in return ,  he helped embezzle more than a billion dollars of public money by a group of businessmen . among them was venezuelan media magnate raul gorrin ,  who also favoured swiss bank accounts .  the owner of the venezuelan media group globovision paid the minister bribes directly from his personal account at hsbc private banking  ( suisse )  sa in geneva .  gorrin was indicted by the us judiciary on november 20 . 34 swiss watchesthe charges against gorrin and andrade show that gorrin used his hsbc account to pay for the veterinary care of andrade’s race horses as well as for three private jets and a yacht . the former minister of hugo chavez’s “bolivarian revolution” was also a big fan of swiss luxury watches .  he owned 34 of them ,  including eight by hublot ,  five by franck muller and four from audemars piguet . gorrin allegedly continued this pattern of corruption after andrade’s departure .  he also bribed andrade’s replacement ,  claudia diaz – who was chavez’s former nurse . a us investigation has been opened against diaz ,  and a request for extradition has been made to spain ,  where she lives with her husband ,  a former bodyguard of the late president . maduro after chavezthe investigations of the us department of justice are no longer limited to chavez’s hires ,  but also to venezuela’s current head of state ,  nicolas maduro . gorrin met us vice president mike pence at the end of 2017 .  according to the miami herald ,  the businessman tried to negotiate the disempowerment of maduro in return for a dismissal of the american lawsuits against him and the “bolivarian bourgeoise” .  it now appears that these efforts have not been as successful as expected . * founded by investigative journalists marie maurisse and françois pilet ,  gotham city is an investigative newsletter specialising in white-collar crime . every week ,  it reports to its subscribers on cases of fraud ,  corruption and money laundering related to the swiss financial centre ,  based on court documents with public access . gotham city regularly offers free access to its articles through swissinfo . ch .   translated from german by susan misicka       sign up for our free newsletters and get the top stories delivered to your inbox .    #mc_embed_signup div . response { margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em  . 5em  . 5em 0; font-weight: bold; float: left; top: -1 . 5em; z-index: 1; width: 80%;} label { display: inline; }    / * add your own mailchimp form style overrides in your site stylesheet or in this style block .  we recommend moving this block and the preceding css link to the head of your html file .  * /       email address     top stories  ( weekly )  latest news  ( daily )  business  ( weekly )  politics  ( weekly )  society  ( weekly )  fintech  ( biweekly )  multinationals  ( biweekly )  click here to see more newsletters              ( function ( $ )  {window . fnames = new array (  ) ; window . ftypes = new array (  ) ;fnames[0]= ' email ' ;ftypes[0]= ' email ' ;fnames[1]= ' fname ' ;ftypes[1]= ' text ' ;fnames[2]= ' lname ' ;ftypes[2]= ' text ' ;} ( jquery )  ) ;var $mcj = jquery . noconflict ( true ) ;      
__label__5     climate change is a reality we need to confront; so is denialism - swi swissinfo . ch              ( keystone )        global warming is real ,  but there are five phases of denial among those who question it ,  explains a political scientist from the university of st gallen .       the three major scientific reports about global warming that came out this year were truly alarming .  in october ,  the intergovernmental panel on climate change  ( ipcc )  reported that limiting the global average temperature to 1 . 5 degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels would save us a lot of trouble . yet it also warned that the international community has increasingly lost sight of the goal it agreed to in paris .  to reach it ,  co2 emissions would need to drop by 45% by 2030 and reach net zero by about 2050 .  but if states continue business as usual ,  the 1 . 5-degree limit will only be reached between 2030 and 2052 .        klaus dingwerth is a political science professor at the university of st gallen ,  switzerland ,  and a non-residential fellow with the global public policy institute in berlin ,  germany .  ( courtesy )        in november ,  the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration  ( noaa )  followed up with its national climate assessment .  prepared by 13 different federal agencies ,  its conclusions were no less clear .  climate change generates new risks and reinforces existing vulnerabilities ,  and it threatens significant losses for infrastructure and property . finally ,  a little more than two weeks ago ,  the world meteorological organization  ( wmo )  reported that the 20 warmest years ever recorded have all occurred in the last 22 years; that the global average temperature in 2018 was about one degree above pre-industrial levels; and that the concentration of greenhouse gases has once more reached new record levels this year . the phases of denialall three reports show that global warming is a reality .  but so is deliberate climate denialism – the overt and sometimes covert activities of those seeking to undermine scientific consensus about the causes and consequences of global warming .  while proponents of climate denialism consistently negate the need to act in the face of climate science ,  they have been very flexible with regard to the arguments they have put forward to argue their case . historically ,  climate denialism has gone through five phases .  in phase one ,  the argument was plain and simple: ‘the planet isn’t warming up’ .  as this proposition could not be maintained for long ,  phase two emphasised natural climate variability: ‘the planet may be warming up ,  but hasn’t there always been climate change ? ’ global warming was said not to be anthropogenic ,  and as human activities could not be blamed ,  there was no need to act .  while this second phase of denialism still has some supporters today – among them the current us president – climate science has made it very clear that we can only explain the patterns of temperature rise after 1850 if we take carbon emissions resulting from industrialisation into account . when scientific evidence made phase two denialism increasingly untenable ,  denialists thus shifted to a third set of arguments .  global warming may be happening ,  they conceded .  it might also be due to our own co2 emissions .  but if it allowed us to grow pineapples in russia ,  then perhaps there are associated benefits as well as costs .  once more ,  however ,  the science was clear .  ipcc reports ,  the stern report ,  the millennium ecosystem assessment  ( mea )  and many other studies have consistently shown that the costs of human-induced climate change would massively outweigh any benefits global warming might have . lack of consensusphase four denialists targeted the integrity of the scientific community itself .  their campaigns ,  which focus on the argument that non-consensus and debate is essential to science ,  have paid off .  but this argument fundamentally confuses climate science with the ipcc ,  which is not a scientific conference ,  but an international body tasked with summarising the existing consensus – or lack thereof – in the field of climate research . states have asked the ipcc to inform them about what is known and what is not known about the causes and likely consequences of global warming . to put it bluntly: while we hold contestation to be central to any scientific endeavour ,  we do not normally question physics ,  because physicists no longer argue over the laws of gravity; we do not normally question economics because economists agree that there is a link between demand ,  supply and prices of goods in a market . this leaves us with a fifth phase .  the arguments presented here are best described as ‘sceptical’; not ‘denialist’ .  those who subscribe to it accept that climate change is real ,  that it is anthropogenic and that it its bad .  yet ,  they hold ,  many other things are bad ,  as well .  so why should global warming come first ? science can’t replace politicsthis argument raises an important issue .  based on the assumption that political attention is a scarce resource ,  it points out that global warming attracts a lot of that attention while other global challenges like malaria or the loss of biological diversity fall by the wayside .  which challenge ought to be tackled with priority ,  however ,  is a deeply political question that cannot be answered by science . i do think this last argument is important .  science cannot replace politics and accepting a responsibility to respond to global warming should not mean we can forget about our responsibilities elsewhere .  but climate change is different in that ,  based on everything we know so far ,  it will act as a catalyst for many ,  if not most ,  other threats humanity confronts .  for example ,  if health challenges like malaria expand ,  that will not affect climate change a great deal; but if global warming increases ,  health challenges like malaria will expand further . if this argument is true ,  there are good reasons to tackle climate change first .  doing so would not only honour the principled idea that ‘if we are to err ,  then let us err on the side of caution’ – an idea the us delegation once espoused in the international ozone talks .  it would also prevent the professional deniers from eventually invoking a sixth reason for inaction – namely that ,  while global warming is both real and bad ,  it is now too late to do much about it . the views expressed in this article are solely those of the author ,  and do not necessarily reflect the views of swissinfo . ch . opinion seriesswissinfo . ch publishes op-ed articles by contributors writing on a wide range of topics – swiss issues or those that impact switzerland .  the selection of articles presents a diversity of opinions designed to enrich the debate on the issues discussed .          sign up for our free newsletters and get the top stories delivered to your inbox .    #mc_embed_signup div . response { margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em  . 5em  . 5em 0; font-weight: bold; float: left; top: -1 . 5em; z-index: 1; width: 80%;} label { display: inline; }    / * add your own mailchimp form style overrides in your site stylesheet or in this style block .  we recommend moving this block and the preceding css link to the head of your html file .  * /       email address     top stories  ( weekly )  latest news  ( daily )  business  ( weekly )  politics  ( weekly )  society  ( weekly )  fintech  ( biweekly )  multinationals  ( biweekly )  click here to see more newsletters              ( function ( $ )  {window . fnames = new array (  ) ; window . ftypes = new array (  ) ;fnames[0]= ' email ' ;ftypes[0]= ' email ' ;fnames[1]= ' fname ' ;ftypes[1]= ' text ' ;fnames[2]= ' lname ' ;ftypes[2]= ' text ' ;} ( jquery )  ) ;var $mcj = jquery . noconflict ( true ) ;

__label__1     glencore begins the changing of the old guard - swi swissinfo . ch             ivan glasenberg has been the ceo of glencore since 2002 .  ( keystone )        the impending retirement of glencore’s copper kingpin telis mistakidis marks the start of a generational shift at the top of the world’s most powerful commodity trader . while some senior executives have left the swiss-based group since its 2011 stock market flotation ,  none of the inner circle surrounding the company’s workaholic boss ivan glasenberg have left — until now . the departure later this year of 56-year-old mr mistakidis signals the break-up of the so-called billionaire boys’ club ,  which built risk-hungry glencore into the commodity industry’s dominant and most talked-about company ,  according to analysts ,  bankers and investors . the leadership changes come as glencore faces a string of legal challenges ,  including a us department of justice investigation into possible corruption and bribery that has put its business model under the microscope .  “they are facing attacks on multiple fronts , ” said anneke van woudenberg ,  executive director of rights and accountability in development ,  a campaign group . “this has got to be creating headaches .  they are all focused on the same central question: fraud ,  corruption and misreporting .  the whole business model is coming under question . ”mr glasenberg would not be drawn last week on any connection between mr mistakidis’s retirement and investigations facing the company over its activities in the democratic republic of congo ,  one of the poorest and most corrupt countries in the world .  “he’s decided to retire and pass on the baton to the next generation , ” mr glasenberg said .  “none of us expect to stay here forever , ” he added .  but analysts have questioned the management changes .          “it’s one of those where you don’t know whether this is being done to appease the regulators ,  and has been done with their consultation ,  or if they’re just trying it out hoping to get them off their backs , ” said ben davis ,  an analyst at liberum . others say glencore ,  which has an appetite for risk that few of its peers can stomach ,  is doing what it always does and moving quickly to get in front of a problem . “they’re trying to be on the front foot ,  they’re the most reactive company in our sector , ” one banker said .  “when things happen they react very quickly . ” one such example was in late 2015 when ,  following a dive in its share price to a record low because of growing concerns about its ability to manage a huge debt pile ,  glencore moved swiftly to strengthen its balance sheet ,  shelving its dividend ,  selling assets and raising money from shareholders .  this time ,  it is the looming investigations by the doj and canada’s ontario securities commission ,  which have rocked the company .  in july ,  glencore said it had been subpoenaed by the doj for documents concerning its business activities in the democratic republic of congo ,  venezuela and nigeria going back to 2007 .  canada’s osc is looking into accounting irregularities at glencore’s subsidiary katanga mining ,  which owns a copper and cobalt mine in the drc that mr mistakidis previously managed . in addition ,  prosecutors in brazil recently announced that glencore ,  as well as its rivals vitol and trafigura ,  were under investigation on suspicion of paying bribes to employees of state-controlled oil company petrobras in exchange for contracts .  these investigations have weighed on glencore’s share price ,  which is down 29 per cent this year . glencore grew out of marc rich & co ,  whose eponymous founder was regarded as the godfather of modern commodity trading .  since 2002 ,  when mr glasenberg took the helm ,  it has been run by a tight-knit group of traders who have been at the company since the 1990s . the most senior lieutenants are daniel maté ,  head of lead and zinc trading; tor peterson ,  head of coal trading; alex beard ,  head of oil; and mr mistakidis . they remain fiercely loyal to mr glasenberg ,  in part for his realisation that glencore needed to expand beyond pure commodity trading into mining as commodity markets became more transparent and technology made information more widely available .  glencore became one of the world’s biggest miners in 2013 when it purchased xstrata in an acrimonious deal .  mr glasenberg also made them fantastically wealthy after glencore’s $60bn flotation in 2011 .  mr mistakidis and mr maté have retained equity stakes worth about £1 . 2bn each . “the management has been here a long time since the float ,  even though people thought since 2011 that a lot of the senior executives would leave , ” said mr glasenberg .  “they haven’t  .   .   .  and there comes a time when the next generation needs to take over . ”some think the management changes announced by glencore last week also reflect its evolution from a commodity trader to a company that makes most of its money by extracting raw materials from the earth .  glencore named peter freyberg ,  a former xstrata executive ,  as its head of mining ,  a new position that reports directly to mr glasenberg .  it also confirmed the retirement of stuart cutler ,  the veteran head of ferroalloys trading ,  and mark catton ,  the head of liquefied natural gas .  “what you’re seeing is a change in glencore’s structure that mirrors its evolution from a private trading company to one of the world’s largest mining companies , ” said paul gait ,  analyst at bernstein research .  “if anything ,  the turbulence of the last year has forced investors to ask more questions about the company ,  about management procedures; whereas before people were focused on the dollars and cents and tonnes out of the ground .  now there’s an increased awareness that these kinds of things have become just as important , ” added mr gait . as the regulatory investigations progress ,  bankers say attention is likely to turn to mr beard ,  who is in charge of oil trading in nigeria and venezuela — two key areas of the doj investigation .  in a recent report ,  analysts at barclays raised the prospect of glencore exiting so-called agency trading in its oil business . during last week’s update with investors ,  mr glasenberg hinted at further senior management changes ,  adding there was a “very good bench of people ready to take over” . “so over the next two to three years ,  you may get another change ,  but you may also get one or two changes .  i don’t know , ” he said .  above all ,  investors are most interested in who will eventually replace mr glasenberg ,  who turns 62 in january and plans to retire in the next three to five years if he has found a suitable replacement .  mr glasenberg says he has a provisional shortlist of candidates ,  some of whom are running business lines ,  and that the ideal replacement would look much like himself and be about 45-years-old .  that effectively rules out the current crop of top executives but puts those like gary nagle ,  the hard-charging south african who was named as the head of glencore’s power coal business last week ,  into the spotlight .  indeed ,  many bankers think glencore’s next chief executive will have to come from the mining side of the business rather than trading .  “i’ve got my eye on a few guys , ” mr glasenberg told journalists last week .  “there’s three to four guys who could potentially be there . ”drc president defends glencore and former partner gertlerjoseph kabila ,  president of the democratic republic of congo ,  defended glencore and its former partner dan gertler ,  both of which have faced us allegations of corruption linked to their operations in the central african country ,  writes tom wilson in kinshasa . mr gertler ,  who partnered glencore in congo for a decade ,  was sanctioned by the us government last year for alleged bribery ,  while glencore in june said the us department of justice had requested information relating to its dealings in congo and two other countries . “i do not want to pronounce myself on any [us justice] issues with glencore and other companies , ” mr kabila said . “they haven’t been found at fault with our own system and if at all there is any problem with the system in america we are very much free and open to discuss these issues with them .  they’ve not done that as yet , ” he said . mr gertler first met mr kabila in 1997 ,  four years before he became president ,  and the two men struck up a lasting friendship that helped mr gertler turn a diamond trading business into a mining empire with stakes in copper ,  cobalt ,  gold ,  iron and oil projects across the congo . he teamed up with glencore in 2007 and was an investor in two of their mining projects in the country until the swiss commodity trader acquired his stakes last year ,  10 months before he was slapped with us sanctions for allegedly making corrupt payments to mr kabila — a charge both men deny . “i have known dan gertler since 1997 , ” mr kabila said .  “he came ,  wanted to do business in the congo ,  has been doing business in the congo [and] definitely we want him to continue to do business in the congo . ”in power for 17 years ,  mr kabila is preparing to stand down after landmark elections this month but says he has no plans to leave politics . glencore’s relationship with the congolese government has been more complicated .  the trading-cum-mining giant is congo’s biggest investor ,  having spent more than $6 . 5bn in the country ,  but has faced a difficult 12 months fighting battles over a joint venture with the state-owned miner and a new mining code ,  which raised taxes . “i believe it has been on and off , ” mr kabila said of his relationship with glencore . “glencore was one of those companies that didn’t want to see a change in the mining code , ” said mr kabila .  “of course ,  they came up with other proposals which we did not accept and we adopted the mining code .  so it has been on and off but i hope that it will be constant as we move forward . ”the new legislation boosted royalties on most metals ,  increased taxes and cancelled a 10-year stability clause that should have protected glencore and other miners from complying with the changes until at least 2028 . despite initial threats from glencore and others to seek international arbitration to block the reforms ,  no such action has been taken to date and mining activity has continued ,  largely unchecked . “we believe that the mining companies were not paying sufficiently what was due to the state , ” mr kabila said .  “since the mining code came into effect the tendency is that we are going to multiply our revenues . ”mining revenue in the first nine months of the year has already more than doubled to $1 . 21bn ,  compared with $489m a year earlier ,  according to the finance ministry . glencore ,  which is one of the country’s biggest taxpayers ,  paid a total of $1 . 1bn to the government in taxes ,  royalties and other contributions in the two years from 2015 to 2017 ,  in addition to separate investments in healthcare ,  education and social development projects ,  according to company filings . in a statement ,  mr gertler’s fleurette group said: “we are proud to be recognised as such a valuable contributor to the growth and development of the democratic republic of congo . “as we have said many times we have always acted appropriately and with integrity in all our dealings there .  our mission has always been to bring in valuable investment in the absence of others being prepared to believe in the country ,  its people and its huge potential . ”glencore declined to comment . copyright the financial times limited 2018​​​​​​​   the financial times         sign up for our free

( john moore / getty images / afp )        over 160 united nations member states have formally adopted an international agreement in morocco that promises a better ,  more coordinated approach to migration .  why is such a pact needed ?  why is it so controversial ,  and why is switzerland ,  which helped shape the accord ,  not attending ?   on monday ,  heads of state and government ministers from 164 countries publicly confirmed in marrakech their commitment to the global compact for safe ,  orderly and regular migration ,  a multilateral accord which was concluded under un auspices earlier this year .  the final 31-page document ,  intergovernmental conference on december 10-11 ,  and endorsement ceremony are the culmination of almost two years’ intensive negotiations ,  involving states ,  members of civil society and the private sector ,  and facilitated by the mexican and swiss ambassadors ,  juan josé gomez camacho and jürg lauber .  why do we need a global migration pact ? according to the un ,  there are around 258 million migrants in the world today .  this figure is expected to grow due to globalization ,  easier communications ,  transport and trade ,  as well as rising inequality ,  demographic imbalances and climate change .  migration ,  the un says ,  provides huge opportunities and benefits for the migrants ,  host communities and communities of origin .  but when migration is poorly organised ,  it can create major headaches and therefore needs to be safer ,  more orderly and regulated .  the pact gained momentum after the migration crisis in europe in 2015 ,  which saw the biggest influx of refugees and migrants since world war two .  it is the fruit of earlier human rights and development treaties and initiatives like the global forum on migration and development ,  and stems from a political commitment known as the “new york declaration for refugees and migrants” ,  adopted unanimously in 2016 by the 193-member un general assembly .  the graph below shows the number of international migrants by major area of destination and major area of origin  ( 2017 figures )  .  [flows have the same colour as their major area of origin .  a small gap between flow and major area indicates the flow’s origin ,  a large gap indicates its destination . ]       number of international migrants in 2017 by major area of destination and major area of origin ( un desa )        what does the pact aim to do ? migration and switzerlandaround one quarter of switzerland ' s 8 . 4 million residents have foreign passports ,  the majority from europe .  the percentage of swiss people who have foreign roots increased slightly last year to 37 . 2% .  this refers to anyone – foreign nationals ,  naturalised swiss citizens ,  as well as swiss citizens at birth – whose parents were both born abroad .  last year ,  net immigration to switzerland from the european union was around 34 , 000 ,  below record years like 2013 when 66 , 000 more people came from the eu than left .  for 2018 ,  net eu immigration through october was 26 , 809 .  meanwhile ,  over 750 , 000 swiss citizens live abroad . states are not ratifying a binding global treaty .  the compact is a non-binding multilateral instrument of cooperation that aims to set common principles and guidelines for orderly migration ,  thereby reducing irregular flows .  the document was created after a lengthy review of migration data and a detailed consultation process .  it contains ten guiding principles and 23 objectives .  for each there is a long list of possible voluntary actions ,  which states can choose from .  these include prevention measures to address the drivers of migration ,  fight human trafficking ,  manage borders and facilitate returns .  it also focuses on solutions and best practices to facilitate regular migration .  “the strength of the compact is that it’s a very comprehensive and balanced document that takes into account both the serious legitimate concerns of those wanting to control borders and the rights of migrants , ” walter kälin ,  a professor of international law at the university of bern ,  told swissinfo . ch .  for vincent chetail ,  director of the global migration centre at the geneva graduate institute ,  the compact does not create new rules but reformulates existing ones .  and although the compact is voluntary ,  he believes it can make a difference .  “a follow-up and review process will be established to assess the implementation of the compact , ” said chetail .  “even if it ' s not legally binding ,  the un general assembly will meet every four years to assess implementation .  there is a strong presumption on paper that these commitments will be taken seriously by states and implemented . ”            migration series  ( part 5 )   switzerland ,  land of european immigration     who’s for it and who’s against ? the document was approved in july by 192 member nations at the un general assembly including switzerland but not the united states ,  which backed out last year saying the issue was “simply not compatible with us sovereignty” .  since then ,  several other nations have rejected the compact ahead of the conference and others are hesitating .  they include israel ,  australia ,  austria ,  poland ,  slovakia ,  bulgaria ,  estonia ,  lithuania ,  the czech republic ,  hungary and the dominican republic .  the austrian government ,  for example ,  is concerned that signing up could eventually help lead to the recognition of a “human right to migration” .  italy ,  whose government has made headlines for its crackdown on migration ,  will decide whether to support the deal after its parliament considers it . un special representative for international migration louise arbour and other supporters of the pact remain confident despite the withdrawals .  she has called moves to reject the accord “regrettable” and “mistaken” .  she says the compact does not affect states '  rights to manage their borders ,  but simply seeks to instil order into cross-border movements .  “it is in no possible sense of the word an infringement on state sovereignty - it is not legally binding ,  it’s a framework for cooperation , ” said arbour ,  comparing it to the 17 un sustainable development goals for 2030 .  former swiss secretary of state ,  peter maurer ,  the current president of the international committee of the red cross  ( icrc )  ,  calls the pact a good compromise .       . articlecontent  . edged . html-fragment {max-width:1400px ! important;} #thumbnailwrapper2 {margin-bottom:5px;text-align:center} #chartthumbnail3 {max-width:800px;margin: 0 auto;overflow:hidden;}  . chartthumbnail iframe {display:block;margin:auto;max-width:800px}        var isoldie =  ( navigator . useragent . indexof ( "msie" )   ! == -1 ) ;  iframeresize ( {heightcalculationmethod: isoldie  ?

__label__9     alpine nations struggle to confront climate change together - swi swissinfo . ch             due to global warming ,  natural disasters like the one that struck bondo in eastern switzerland in 2017 could occur more often .  ( gian ehrenzeller  /  keystone )        rising temperatures will have a profound effect on the alps .  yet despite everything they have in common ,  alpine nations are having a hard time joining efforts to address climate change . at the 24th conference of the parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change  ( cop24 )  in katowice ,  the polish presidency is concentrating on three main themes: technology ,  man and nature . in the alps – the melting “water-towers” of europe as well an outdoor playground – coping with climate change is complicated by the fact that so many cultures and countries are involved . “climate change is affecting the alps more severely than other areas , ” according to the eight-state alpine convention ,  which predicts that mountain areas – and their rapidly shrinking glaciers – will be hit harder by rising temperatures than other european areas . this image from the alps in 25 maps shows the projected temperature change from 2021-2050 .         ( permanent secretariat of the alpine convention ,  the alps in 25 maps  ( 2017 )  * )        possible scenarios include extreme weather events like heavy rainfall and drought ,  which can lead to rockfall ,  flooding and forest fires while threatening the water supply for drinking ,  agriculture and hydropower . markus reiterer ,  alpine convention secretary general ,  calls for more as well as better cooperation . “the alps cannot do without cooperation .  we have so many different countries and stakeholders ,  and dozens of regions .  i think we’re pretty good at it already ,  but there’s always the chance of duplication and stepping on toes , ” he said ,  ticking off various alpine interest groups at a recent international commission for the protection of the alps event . technologyelectromobility tops the polish list for “climate-friendly modern solutions” .  cross-border mobility in the alpine region – where emissions are a threat to the landscape and its residents – is a particular concern of swiss parliamentarian thomas egger ,  the director of the swiss center for mountain regions . according to egger ,  the issue is barely on the international political radar because it’s eclipsed by discussions on freight ,  tourism ,  and tunnels like the gotthard – which cuts through switzerland to link the regions north and south of the alps .  egger says data is a missing link . “we don’t have harmonized data on the european level .  for instance ,  italy collects data on cross-border mobility only every ten years .  switzerland does it every four months , ” egger told swissinfo . ch .  this map [draft version] shows the hotspots where inbound commuter traffic is heaviest .         ( alpine region preparatory action fund )        egger hopes that increased cooperation can help spark change in the form of practical international solutions like better train timetable coordination ,  traffic lanes for high-occupancy vehicles and perhaps financial disincentives for cross-border commuting – all of which could help to lower co2 emissions caused by cars in the alps . despite the challenges ,  he’s optimistic about the potential for better cooperation among the alpine nations ,  noting that switzerland can import european ideas without being a member of the eu .  and vice-versa . “we can really learn from each other and exchange good practices within this alpine arc .  in switzerland ,  every municipality with at least 100 inhabitants must be served by public transport ,  which is unique in the whole alpine area .  so we can export this idea , ” he quips . manwhen it comes to mankind ,  the polish presidency of cop24 is calling for the “fair social and economic transformation of industrial regions” .  these might be far from the alps ,  but the concept of sustainable living calls on consumers everywhere to consider how goods are produced – and at what cost to workers and the environment . this notion of fostering respect is invoked when environmentalists refer to “ecosystem services” – in other words ,  what nature can offer to people .      alice labadini of eurac research explains that a key goal of the nearly-finished ,  eu-funded alpes  ( alpine ecosystem services )  project was to come up with frameworks that can help shape governance and solve conflicts between sectors and territories .  over a three-year period ,  she and her colleagues from around the alps worked to map the alpine region’s ecosystem services and assign a value to them – switzerland included . “switzerland is part of the alpine space programme so we also mapped swiss territory .  sometimes this was a challenge because a lot of the databases are provided by the eu and they lack swiss data ,  but we had a good relationship with the swiss authorities and we managed to collect it , ” labadini told swissinfo . ch . nature“supporting achieving climate neutrality by absorbing co2 by forests and land ,  or by water management” is the third theme being highlighted in katowice as the world’s nations try to limit global warming to 2°c . water management was the focus of spare: strategic planning for alpine river ecosystems ,  another three-year project that winds down on december 15 .  the engadine in eastern switzerland was among its five pilot regions .      the result of the work around the river inn was a management plan with various projects to enhance biodiversity and human welfare in the engadine valley .  project leader angelika abderhalden was especially pleased with the results of this past summer’s youth river camp in zernez ,  which taught 18-28-year-olds about river basin management and strategic planning approaches – with a view towards applying them to their rivers back home ,  also outside of the alpine region . “it’s so important to get the youth involved .  there were even participants from spain and myanmar ! ” she told swissinfo . ch ,  emphasizing the importance of better international communication ,  not least for the exchange of ideas . within the alps ,  abderhalden thinks the people have more in common than not .  “the alpine region is like a huge community ,  and it doesn’t matter which language they speak or which region it is – they have pride in their heritage . ”alpine summitsin late november ,  swi attended back-to-back alpine environmental summits held in innsbruck ,  austria .  one was the eusalp  ( eu-strategy for the alpine region )  forum hosted by tyrol as its 2018 presidency winds down .  the other was the final conference of alpes  ( alpine ecosystem services )  and spare: strategic planning for alpine river ecosystems ,  two projects run by the alpine space programme and finishing on december 15 ,  2018 . * full credit for map featured above: permanent secretariat of the alpine convention  ( 2017 )  ,  the alps in 25 maps  ( 2017 )  .  authors: eurac research ,  insitute for earth observation ,  institute for regional development ,  petitta m .  ,  renner k .  ,  ravazzoli e .  ,  laner p .        climate change  torrid time predicted for switzerland by 2060               sign up for our free newsletters and get the top stories delivered to your inbox .    #mc_embed_signup div . response { margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em  . 5em  . 5em 0; font-weight: bold; float: left; top: -1 . 5em; z-index: 1; width: 80%;} label { display: inline; }    / * add your own mailchimp form style overrides in your site stylesheet or in this style block .  we recommend moving this block and the preceding css link to the head of your html file .  * /       email address     top stories  ( weekly )  latest news  ( daily )  business  ( weekly )  politics  ( weekly )  society  ( weekly )  fintech  ( biweekly )  multinationals  ( biweekly )  click here to see more newsletters              ( function ( $ )  {window . fnames = new array (  ) ; window . ftypes = new array (  ) ;fnames[0]= ' email ' ;ftypes[0]= ' email ' ;fnames[1]= ' fname ' ;ftypes[1]= ' text ' ;fnames[2]= ' lname ' ;ftypes[2]= ' text ' ;} ( jquery )  ) ;var $mcj = jquery . noconflict ( true ) ;

__label__1     swiss government wants public consultation on eu framework deal - swi swissinfo . ch             switzerland is not a member of the european union ,  but the close ties between the two are governed by over 120 bilateral sectoral accords negotiated since 1992 ( martin ruetschi / keystone )        the swiss government says it wants to carry out a public consultation before taking a final position on an “institutional framework” agreement negotiated with the european union aimed at cementing future ties between switzerland and its biggest trading partner .   the seven-member federal council  ( executive body )  said on friday that it had asked the foreign ministry to carry out a national consultation with relevant actors – political parties ,  cantons ,  parliament and associations .  “these consultations will serve as a basis for a thorough analysis of the political interests with a view to a possible signature of the agreement , ” it said .  according to former diplomat paul widmer ,  there was too much divergence in opinion among swiss stakeholders to conclude the negotiations .  “putting the dossier through a new hoop is the only solution that remains .  the federal council cannot accept the draft .  domestic resistance is too strong .  nor can it reject it outright without snubbing brussels , ” he told swissinfo . chsince 2014 ,  talks have been taking place to formalise relations between the two sides ,  now covered by around 120 separate accords that have been negotiated since a 1992 referendum in the alpine state rejected joining the european economic area .  the proposed overarching agreement on the table covers five of the larger bilateral deals: free movement of persons ,  mutual recognition of industrial standards ,  agricultural products ,  air transport and land transport .  under the negotiated accord ,  swiss rules would automatically adapt to be in line with eu law .  the treaty would also aim to provide a more effective platform to resolve disputes using arbitration panels to handle disagreements while still giving the european court of justice  ( ecj )  a say in how to interpret law .  + putting the institutional framework agreement in contextbrussels wants switzerland to agree a treaty before granting greater access to eu markets and has been pushing bern to agree a treaty this year amid ongoing brexit talks and before elections in switzerland and the eu scheduled for 2019 .  the situation is extremely delicate for the swiss government ,  which has been wrestling with the long-running talks and risks upsetting brussels ,  the swiss parliament and the swiss population .  the talks hit an impasse because of swiss opposition from the traditionally pro-europe left and unions and the anti-eu conservative right who believe the framework deal encroaches too much on swiss sovereignty .  disagreement centres on swiss rules protecting local high wages and the costs of switzerland accepting the eu’s principle of the free movement of people .  there are also objections to the role of the ecj and eu rules on state aid ,  which could affect publicly guaranteed swiss cantonal banks . possible consequencesthe eu is switzerland’s biggest trading partner .  two-thirds of swiss foreign trade is with the eu .  around 1 . 4 million eu citizens live in switzerland -

__label__9     ‘the more we take democracies for granted ,  the less prepared we are to defend them’ - swi swissinfo . ch             swiss foreign minister ignazio cassis ,  originally from italian-speaking ticino ,  joined the federal council in 2017 .  ( thomas kern / swissinfo . ch )        switzerland’s foreign minister says defending human rights and democracy building remain at the heart of switzerland’s agenda ,  even as the un universal declaration of human rights – now 70 years old – has come under pressure internationally . ignazio cassis also spoke to swissinfo . ch about populism ,  arms exports and switzerland’s place in the world today . swissinfo . ch: do your foreign colleagues often ask you about direct democracy in switzerland ? ignazio cassis: i hardly ever get asked up-front about direct democracy .  this is for the simple reason that the term “direct democracy” is not widely known in other countries and societies .  however ,  i often refer to our popular rights when i try to explain the swiss systemwhat actually makes the swiss tick ?  this is a question we often put to ourselves .  i think that every answer involves direct democracy .  it’s a cumbersome system that requires a lot of energy .  at the same time ,  directly involving swiss citizens contributes to solid social ,  political and economic stability .  this is what many in the world envy us for . swissinfo . ch: is such a system only possible in switzerland ? i . c . : we have a good historic base for such a system .  we never had kings or emperors ,  which means we never had absolute concentration of power .  however ,  many nations all over the world are currently trying to find new approaches to better involve their citizens in politics and create a direct democracy system . many of these attempts are still in their infancies ,  such as the european union’s citizens’ initiative .  the brexit referendum in the united kingdom is another example ,  and its implementation continues to be controversial to this day .  the swiss are used to going to the ballot box to vote on an issue four times per year .  on the eve of election sunday ,  the situation is clear and the results are usually accepted by everyone involved .  this may sound banal ,  but on a global scale it is anything but . swissinfo . ch: according to the swiss constitution ,  democracy building is a priority of swiss foreign policy .  what does that involve ? i . c . : in foreign policy ,  this is not always easy ,  since promoting democracy and human rights is mainly a domestic policy issue in most countries .  for this reason ,  switzerland focuses on cooperation projects aimed at building democracies through decentralisation .  less concentration of power gives the citizens more possibilities to decide and participate in a decision . this ,  on the other hand ,  can only work if apart from political power ,  the financial sector is also democratised and decentralised . swissinfo . ch: can you name a few examples where switzerland has successfully contributed to democracy building ? i . c . : in tunisia ,  for example ,  we have supported decentralisation measures for the last eight years since the arab spring .  through such measures ,  citizens’ participation is also strengthened .  our projects also support the promotion of women ,  as we know from experience that in many countries women are better at managing finances and are more likely to ensure that the basic requirements of the local population are met .  what’s important is that we don’t just export the swiss model ,  but share our experience . swissinfo . ch: this sounds more complicated than a simple recipe for success that you can share with the world as a member of the swiss government and foreign minister . i . c . : of course ,  we must not overestimate our impact .  during a decentralisation process it is also important to take into account the differences and inequalities of the various people or regions . this is something that really struck me in india .  this federally organised country is increasingly wondering how many inequalities a state can take .  this is why they are slowly harmonising the tax system .  switzerland has a lot of experience in this field and it is certainly something we can share . swissinfo . ch: democracies are not faring particularly well in many parts of the world .  human rights are violated ,  freedom of the press is limited ,  elections and popular votes are rigged .  are you worried about these developments ? i . c . : we will always have to fight for freedom proactively !  once we stop ,  we lose .  paradoxically ,  the crises many liberal democracies are faced with at the moment have contributed to their successes . as a doctor ,  i see an analogy with vaccinations .  the better an vaccine works against an illness ,  the less people are inclined to get vaccinated .  they are no longer aware of the risks of getting sick .  the more we take democracies for granted ,  the less prepared we are to defend them . these days there is a lot of talk about a populist wave .  however ,  we are also experiencing a revival of paternalism rebuffing demands for more co-determination and division of power ,  but blaming populists for it .  this is also part of the reason why our liberal democracy is coming under pressure .  that fills me with concern . swissinfo . ch: in some places ,  journalists get killed for simply doing their jobs .  how do you ,  as swiss foreign minister ,  respond to these violations of human rights ? i . c . : by directly reacting on a political level ,  by showing public outrage and by implementing concrete measures .  take the case of the murder of the saudi journalist jamal khashoggi ,  which was a severe violation of human rights .  we immediately called for a quick ,  comprehensive and independent inquiry .  this move will most certainly have consequences for our international relationships .  for example ,  we suspended our exports of spare weapon parts to saudi arabia and we drew attention to the human rights situation in saudi arabia in political meetings .  however ,  we can’t just cut all ties with riyadh as switzerland builds on direct dialogue and has a historic role to play as mediator .  we can realise this role with protective power mandates .  it would not be the end of the world if switzerland did not exist ,  but the world would have yet another problem . swissinfo . ch: what about domestic and economic interests ?  when it comes to weapons exports to saudi arabia ,  don’t they compromise our human rights policies ? i . c . : that is correct ,  and there is a clear conflict of interest .  however ,  due to our history and democracy we are far more reserved in the arms export business than the european union .  according to our constitution ,  we have to secure our safety and independence and for this we need a small defence industry .  for economic reasons ,  this industry needs to be able to export goods abroad ,  but only to countries that are not involved in a conflict . swissinfo . ch: it was only recently though that the government decided not to relax the guidelines for arms exports .  why not ?   i . c . : in this case ,  the government initially reacted to a proposal by the senate’s safety commission which was concerned about our arms industry .  however ,  when the government submitted a draft law to parliament ,  it was heavily criticised on humanitarian grounds .  in other words ,  the division of power prevailing all over switzerland worked once again .  we want to do one thing ,  but not give up the other even if it’s about controversial issues like in this case . i . c . : for every small country ,  a multilateral system of agreements and conventions is the alpha and omega .  it is important to apply the power of the law ,  and not the law of power .  once the law of power prevails ,  we are no longer in good shape . international law protects switzerland .  however ,  this does not mean that it should take over .  we simply need it as much as necessary and as little as possible .  this is the only way to maintain our independence . 70 years of the un ' s human rights declarationthe universal declaration of human rights  ( udhr )  was adopted by the united nations general assembly on 10 december 1948 .  it was designed to prevent a repetition of the human rights violations committed during the second world war .  it was drafted by a diverse group from various countries and is based on the basic premise that all people are “born free and equal in dignity and rights” .  it comprises 30 articles ,  including the right to "direct participation of citizens in the shaping of a country ' s public affairs"  ( art .  21 . 1 .  )  .   although the declaration represents "soft law" - it is not legally binding - it serves as a basis for numerous international and internationally binding agreements .  these include the international covenant on civil and political rights  ( un covenant ii )  and the european convention of human rights  ( echr )  .  based on the declaration ,  switzerland made the promotion of democracy and human rights an integral part of its foreign policy .  to mark the 70th anniversary ,  the un high commissioner for human rights michelle bachelet declared this week in geneva that the udhr remains relevant but warned that progress is “under threat” .   “we need to stand up more energetically for the rights it showed us everyone should have – not just ourselves but all our fellow human beings – and which we are at constant risk of eroding through our own ,  and our leaders’ forgetfulness ,  neglect or wanton disregard , ” she said .    swissinfo . ch         sign up for our free newsletters and get the top stories delivered to your inbox .    #mc_embed_signup div . response { margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em  . 5em  . 5em 0; font-weight: bold; float: left; top: -1 . 5em; z-index: 1; width: 80%;} label { display: inline; }    / * add your own mailchimp form style overrides in your site stylesheet or in this style block .  we recommend moving this block and the preceding css link to the head of your html file .  * /       email address     top stories  ( weekly )  latest news  ( daily )  business  ( weekly )  politics  ( weekly )  society  ( weekly )  fintech  ( biweekly )  multinationals  ( biweekly )  click here to see more newsletters              ( function ( $ )  {window . fnames = new array (  ) ; window . ftypes = new array (  ) ;fnames[0]= ' email ' ;ftypes[0]= ' email ' ;fnames[1]= ' fname ' ;ftypes[1]= ' text ' ;fnames[2]= ' lname ' ;ftypes[2]= ' text ' ;} ( jquery )  ) ;var $mcj = jquery . noconflict ( true ) ;      
__label__2     famous swiss orchestra marks 100 years - swi swissinfo . ch      as western switzerland ' s symphony orchestra  ( the "orchestre de la suisse romande" )  turns 100 ,  a look back at its long legacy . osr was once internationally famous thanks to the work and connections of its founder ,  ernest ansermet .  this video from swiss public television ,  rts ,  tells the story of the great director and his successors .  ansermet founded the osr to counterbalance the large symphony orchestras in zurich ,  basel and bern .  he remained music director for 49 years ,  from 1918 to 1967 ,  and created a vast store of recordings with the record label decca ,  that made the orchestra a household name worldwide .  the osr was famous for its interpretation of the 20th-century french and russian repertories .  ansermet was a close associate of ravel ,  rachmaninoff and debussy ,  and he conducted important premieres for igor stravinsky .  lady gaga - why nott ? these days the symphony orchestra is fighting to re-establish its international reputation .  the osr ,  made up of 112 permanent musicians ,  is based in geneva at the victoria hall ,  but should have a new concert hall by 2023 / 24 .  a building project is underway .  in addition to symphony concerts ,  the osr performs as the opera orchestra in productions at the  ' grand théâtre de genève '  .  in january 2017 ,  jonathan nott ,  who is english ,  became the new music and artistic director .  he was recently asked by a swiss radio journalist which star he would like to bring to geneva to perform with the osr .  without hesitation ,  he replied ,  "lady gaga" . in december 2016 ,  ahead of nott ' s appointment ,  the orchestra was audited for the first time because of successive changes to its management since 2012 .  the verdict was that the level of its artistic performance was insufficient .  steve emmenegger ,  who headed the inquiry ,  said it would be nott ' s job to "put the osr back to the level it should be at" .

__label__3     swiss regulation of commodity trade long overdue - swi swissinfo . ch             the resource curse refers to the paradox that countries with an abundance of natural resources ,  tend to have less economic growth ,  less democracy ,  and worse development outcomes than countries with fewer natural resources ( keystone )        several global commodity traders that call switzerland home have been repeatedly accused of violating human rights and environmental standards .  andreas missbach of the ngo public eye believes the responsible business initiative is necessary for reining them in .       five years after releasing its background report on commodities ,  the swiss government published a reassessment of the situation at the end of november – “the swiss commodities sector: current situation and outlook” .  despite numerous scandals involving commodity firms in geneva and zug ,  the federal council has once again missed the opportunity to adopt effective measures against corruption and ward off other risks .  yet again ,  it seems to be content with asking the swiss multinational commodity trading and mining company glencore and its pals “to act with integrity and responsibility” .        andreas missbach is the head of commodities at public eye .  ( marion nitsch / zvg )        in 2013 ,  at least the federal council’s message was clear .  it talked about “serious challenges regarding human rights and environmental conditions in commodity-exporting countries ,  anti-corruption regulations as well as the ‘resource curse’ phenomenon in developing countries” .  in the end ,  however ,  it did not seem to take these challenges seriously enough to come up with effective regulatory measures .  it has also ignored concerns coming from parliament . since 2015 ,  the federal council has only supported one of eight proposals  ( motions and postulates )  put forward by parliament .  in this respect ,  the 2018 reassessment is consistent ,  it focuses on strengthening switzerland’s competitiveness as an international business hub .  five measures are now dedicated to this cause ,  up from two .  one of them is the introduction of a tonnage tax under which the taxable profits of shipping companies would be calculated as a lump sum based on the net tonnage of their ships ,  rather than on their profits .  for commodity giants owning significant fleets such as vitol ,  glencore or tragifure this would open a tax loophole as big as a barn door . there is an urgent need to fight corruption but the search for a concrete solution seems to be in vain .  instead ,  the state secretariat for economic affairs  ( seco )  simply wants to continue to “raise awareness” .  in its quest to do so ,  it surprisingly updated one of its brochures last year ,  even though the scandals in the industry are by no means fading .  on the contrary ,  it happens far too often that globally dominating swiss commodity firms are partially to blame for the “resource curse” .  no matter whether it’s deals with oligarchs from congo or kazakhstan ,  the revelations of the paradise papers or the epochal corruption case surrounding the brazilian state oil company petrobas ,  dangerous practices of “our” commodity firms whereby they use dubious door openers or enter partnerships with politically exposed people just to gain access to lucrative markets keep on coming to the surface . switzerland’s political inertia has not gone unnoticed though .  in its evaluation of the swiss anti-corruption mechanism last march ,  the oecd called on our government to impose “appropriate and obligatory regulations” on commodity trade .  judicial authorities in the us and brazil have also started investigating the business practices of glencore ,  trafigura ,  vitol and other commodity firms . even the obligation for commodity firms to disclose payments to governments ,  the only legal measure that has been tackled since 2013 ,  is in danger of becoming a farce .  the federal council only wants to introduce transparency rules for commodity extraction ,  even though an overwhelming majority of swiss companies are involved in the trade of commodities .  this “alibi bill” would only affect four out of 544 companies in the industry .  the billions of francs from commodity trade ,  especially from crude oil ending up with government agencies of countries where corruption is endemic will remain in the dark .  this opens countless opportunities for potentates and their entourage to simply help themselves .  it is now up to the senate to rectify this scandalous omission . when it comes to human rights ,  the federal council prides itself with the “guidance on implementing the un guiding principles on business and human rights” which was developed by a working group of representatives from trading companies ,  their lobby organisations ,  non-governmental organisations and administration .  the swiss ngo public eye participated in the multi-stakeholder consultation process .  after years of procrastination and endless discussions with an industry that is more interested in burnishing its image rather than tackling the problems ,  the guidelines were published at the very last minute .  however ,  the federal council also relies on voluntary action even when it comes to human rights .  it is up to the commodity firms if and how the un’s guiding principles on human rights are implemented .  only initiatives such as the ‘responsible business’ initiative could force this high-risk sector to adopt them ,  and the established guidelines are there to tell them how to do it . the times of completely trusting in voluntary action should be over .  five years ago ,  the federal council identified a “reputational risk” in the behaviour of swiss-based companies ,  and even though it is against all evidence ,  it no longer sees it today .  if the government in bern continues to sleep “the sleep of the unjust” ,  it is only a question of time until – just like in the financial sector - pressure from abroad forces it to act . the views expressed in this article are solely those of the author ,  and do not necessarily reflect the views of swissinfo . ch .    __       sign up for our free newsletters and get the top stories delivered to your inbox .    #mc_embed_signup div . response { margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em  . 5em  . 5em 0; font-weight: bold; float: left; top: -1 . 5em; z-index: 1; width: 80%;} label { display: inline; }    / * add your own mailchimp form style overrides in your site stylesheet or in this style block .  we recommend moving this block and the preceding css link to the head of your html file .  * /       email address     top stories  ( weekly )  latest news  ( daily )  business  ( weekly )  politics  ( weekly )  society  ( weekly )  fintech  ( biweekly )  multinationals  ( biweekly )  click here to see more newsletters              ( function ( $ )  {window . fnames = new array (  ) ; window . ftypes = new array (  ) ;fnames[0]= ' email ' ;ftypes[0]= ' email ' ;fnames[1]= ' fname ' ;ftypes[1]= ' text ' ;fnames[2]= ' lname ' ;ftypes[2]= ' text ' ;} ( jquery )  ) ;var $mcj = jquery . noconflict ( true ) ;      
__label__3     swiss commodity traders at the forefront of best practices - swi swissinfo . ch             commodity trading accounts for nearly 4% of switzerland’s gdp with more than 500 companies active in the industry .   ( keystone )        switzerland is at the forefront of best practices when it comes to addressing modern supply chain challenges ,  argues stéphane graber of the country ' s trading and shipping association .        in 2013 the federal council published the background report on commodities ,  underscoring the economic importance of commodity trading for switzerland ,  an activity representing 3 . 8% of the swiss gdp and numerous jobs in all regions of switzerland .  it also underlined some of the challenges faced in commodity trading and the criticism from some advocacy ngos ,  revealing a gap in understanding of the role and function of commodity trading . in the five years following the publication of the background report ,  the swiss trading and shipping association  ( stsa )  has walked the talk .  relying on the expertise of all its members ,  stsa has proactively engaged in a constructive approach and participated in a multi-stakeholder initiative for the elaboration of a guidance on implementing the un guiding principles on business and human rights  ( ungps )  ,  together with the swiss authorities and representatives of civil society . new guidancethe new guidance ,  published by the swiss authorities on november 28 ,  is an important milestone in this process of continuous dialogue .  it has enabled a better understanding of the commodity trading activity and the challenges related to human rights .   it also responds to a key priority for companies in the field of human rights ,  namely the illustration of practical examples on what is expected of companies in the implementation of the ungps . stsa is fully committed to the promotion of the ungps ,  including through this new guidance ,  its code of conduct .  this commitment is reflected in the launch on november 13 of a dedicated training course with the new stsa certificate on business and human rights ,  and an online platform for facilitating exchanges on best practices for companies active in commodity trading .  these exchanges help to address and overcome problems faced ,  for example ,  by smes not having the resources to engage directly with local communities in high risk countries and who seek alternative ways on how to proceed .        dr .  stéphane graber is the secretary general of stsa  ( swiss trading and shipping association )  ,  the swiss nationwide professional association for the commodity trading and shipping industry in switzerland .  dr .  graber is also the chairman of egtsa .  fully owned by stsa ,  egtsa provides a secure communication platform for commodity trading companies and commodity trade-financing banks  ( trafec )  .  ( courtesy of stsa )        stsa and its members did not stop there .  they have actively engaged in the swiss centre of expertise in human rights as a member of its advisory board by supporting the creation of a swiss national human rights institution in line with the paris principles .  in parallel ,  stsa members have further developed their risk management systems with a particular focus on human rights in an increasingly challenging international context .  such challenges include the negative impacts on local communities in the case of withdrawal of a company following the introduction of sanctions . a platform for exchangegiven the international nature of the commodity trading activity ,  unilateral action by switzerland would be largely ineffective to address modern supply chain challenges .  adapted regulation in this area can only be international and multilateral .  for this reason ,  stsa and its members are active in the pilot project on the implementation of the oecd-fao guidance for responsible agricultural supply chains .  the aim of the project is to offer a platform of exchange for companies and trade associations on best practices and challenges . stsa welcomes the new federal report assessing the current situation and outlook of the swiss commodities sector .  building on several progress reports and published on november 30 ,  this report acknowledges the work that commodity trading actors have undertaken during these five years ,  as well as the importance of maintaining the competitiveness of commodity trading in switzerland which contributes chf25 billion in revenue for the country . while switzerland remains an attractive location ,  the hub is under constant pressure given the attractiveness of singapore ,  dubai and london .  ensuring good framework conditions is therefore key .  in this context ,  the real challenge will be to diffuse swiss best practices worldwide and support a level-playing field .  an isolated action of switzerland will not help to meet the objectives of improving the integrity of global supply chains . however ,  tomorrow’s challenges will be completely different due to the emergence of new technologies and digitalisation .  we believe some of the highly complex issues such as traceability or transparency that we confront today will be addressed more easily in the near future .  ensuring good framework conditions that allow one to be at the forefront of innovation will therefore be critical for swiss commodity trading in the coming years . the views expressed in this article are solely those of the author ,  and do not necessarily reflect the views of swissinfo . ch .    __       sign up for our free newsletters and get the top stories delivered to your inbox .    #mc_embed_signup div . response { margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em  . 5em  . 5em 0; font-weight: bold; float: left; top: -1 . 5em; z-index: 1; width: 80%;} label { display: inline; }    / * add your own mailchimp form style overrides in your site stylesheet or in this style block .  we recommend moving this block and the preceding css link to the head of your html file .  * /       email address     top stories  ( weekly )  latest news  ( daily )  business  ( weekly )  politics  ( weekly )  society  ( weekly )  fintech  ( biweekly )  multinationals  ( biweekly )  click here to see more newsletters              ( function ( $ )  {window . fnames = new array (  ) ; window . ftypes = new array (  ) ;fnames[0]= ' email ' ;ftypes[0]= ' email ' ;fnames[1]= ' fname ' ;ftypes[1]= ' text ' ;fnames[2]= ' lname ' ;ftypes[2]= ' text ' ;} ( jquery )  ) ;var $mcj = jquery . noconflict ( true ) ;

( tech .  sgt .  robert cloys / us department of defense )        from aerial surveillance cameras to autonomous reconnaissance drones: swiss universities are participating in projects funded by the us military .  what are the guidelines when it comes to such sensitive collaboration ?  argus panoptes is a giant in greek mythology who has a hundred eyes .  he was tasked by the goddess hera to guard her priestess io from being seduced by zeus .  the hundred-eyed argus is ideally suited to keep watch on io .  no wonder that the us defense advanced research projects agency  ( darpa )  named its first gigapixel  ( one billion pixels )  surveillance camera project argus-is  ( autonomous real-time ground ubiquitous surveillance imaging system )  .  meant to be mounted on drones ,  the cameras could scan an area half the size of manhattan and track moving vehicles and people .  it was first tested in 2010 and operationalised in 2014 .      at around the same time  ( 2011-12 )  the swiss federal institute of technology in lausanne  ( epfl )  was working on a darpa-funded project called knowledge enhanced exapixel imaging  ( keep )  .  the objective was to come up with new techniques for super-resolution image compression .  back then ,  compressing huge pictures required tremendous computing power .  the keep project worked on using mathematics and machine learning to find new ways of compressing images that required less computing power .  “the research led at epfl had no direct application in scope ,  since it was very fundamental work .  the team aimed at demonstrating theoretically if a 100x compression ratio could be achieved in such gigapixels images , ” a spokesperson for epfl told swissinfo . ch .  the argus-is gigapixel cameras were designed for drones and it is believed that they have been incorporated into the newer version of “gorgon stare pods” observed on mq9 reaper drones .  these are the first “hunter-killer” drones deployed the us air force and are equipped with 500-pound bombs and hellfire missiles .  is it possible that these potentially lethal machines are armed with gigapixel cameras that process images with the help of epfl research ?  epfl isn’t certain that its keep project is connected to argus-is in any way .  “we do not have any information on that .  that work and its funding was rather most probably part of the fundamental research efforts led by the us as well as any other army ,  and not directly connected to a specific project such as this one , ” says epfl .  in other words ,  there is no way of knowing if the us military actually used epfl research to track and kill enemies with mq9 reaper drones .  darpa did not reply to a swissinfo . ch request asking if the swiss research was used in the development of argus-is .  ethical guidelines swiss regulations require researchers working on such topics to get authorisation from the state secretariat for economic affairs  ( seco )  .  the swiss federal act on the control of dual-use goods ,  specific military goods and strategic goods also covers export of technology ,  software and information that can have potential military uses .  however ,  a loophole exists that helps universities avoid the cumbersome process of obtaining authorisation for collaborations with darpa: export controls do not apply to “basic scientific research” .  “according to annex 1 of the swiss goods control ordinance and based on the guidelines of the international export control regimes ,  export controls do not apply to technology in the public domain ,  to basic scientific research or to the minimum necessary information for patent applications , ” a seco representative told swissinfo . ch .  the term “basic scientific research” fits almost all darpa-funded projects allowing researchers to circumvent regulations on the export of technology .         a prototype telescopic contact lens developed by epfl as part of a darpa-funded project .  ( epfl )        do researchers have any say or responsibility when it comes to working on so-called “dual-use”  ( civil and military applications )  projects ?  epfl’s guidelines let scientists off the hook on this question .  “individual scientists / engineers should not take upon themselves the entire responsibility of deciding whether or not to engage in military defence research or in joint military-civilian programs , ” say the guidelines .  the issue is framed as a research policy question that is the remit of a range of stakeholders beyond just universities like the scientific community ,  government and civil society .  however ,  apart from the subject of export of weapons ,  there has been little public debate on the subject from a research collaboration point of view .  sensitive projectsthe gigapixel camera-relevant research is not the only darpa-funded project carried out by epfl .  researchers at the laboratory of applied photonic devices have developed a prototype telescope contact lens that offers magnified vision to the wearer .  it is billed as a promising aid for those suffering from age-related vision loss .  however ,  it is not clear why darpa would be interested in funding such a project .    the idiap research institute in martigny ,  which is affiliated to epfl ,  has worked on a darpa project called “media forensics” that focused on detecting manipulation of audio and video sources .  it has discontinued collaboration with darpa for fear of attracting controversy .  “although quite active in the past ,  even as coordinator ,  idiap is currently no longer involved in such  ( quite unstable and politically-sensitive )  projects , ” states the institute’s research programme for 2017 to 2020 .  epfl’s photonics and quantum measurements lab  ( k-lab )  has also worked on a darpa project to develop tiny ,  high power-efficiency micro-photonic chips with applications for data centres in telecommunications .  and it is not just epfl that is a darpa research partner .  the quantum optoelectrics group of zurich’s federal institute of technology  ( ethz )  has worked for darpa’s scout programme that researches techniques to rapidly identify chemical and biological agents in real-life settings .  another darpa-funded zurich project is one by the university of zurich’s institute of neuroinformatics .  they received funding to work on darpa’s fast lightweight autonomy  ( fla )  programme to help in the development of small autonomous drones .  these drones are meant for rescue but also for potential military operations like “safely and quickly scanning for threats inside a building before military teams enter” .       close relationshipthe relationship between swiss universities and darpa is more than just isolated projects in sensitive domains .  researchers are encouraged to take part in competitions and challenges funded by darpa .  darpa managers are also invited to swiss universities to give talks and are also occasionally invited to research workshops to help show what swiss research has to offer .  for example ,  in 2014 ,  darpa managers were invited to a four-day research workshop organised by epfl in the lakeside swiss town of ascona .  “in addition the workshop was visited by leading program managers from the esa [european space agency] as well as the darpa agency .  therefore the workshop provided an opportunity to showcase the research in this field to leading program managers , ” says the workshop report .  collaboration with darpa has also given wings to the idea of a swiss academic-corporate-military entity .  one of three interactive workshops organised on swiss cybersecurity day in 2017 was entitled “towards a swiss darpa” .  panel members - including former us national security agency  ( nsa )  senior staffer curtis dukes - spoke on the need to channel switzerland’s “academic superpower” ,  “strong private sector” and “militia army” for a national cybersecurity strategy .          sign up for our free newsletters and get the top stories delivered to your inbox .    #mc_embed_signup div . response { margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em  . 5em  . 5em 0; font-weight: bold; float: left; top: -1 . 5em; z-index: 1; width: 80%;} label { display: inline; }    / * add your own mailchimp form style overrides in your site stylesheet or in this style block .  we recommend moving this block and the preceding css link to the head of your html file .  * /       email address     top stories  ( weekly )  latest news  ( daily )  business  ( weekly )  politics  ( weekly )  society  ( weekly )  fintech  ( biweekly )  multinationals  ( biweekly )  click here to see more newsletters              ( function ( $ )  {window . fnames = new array (  ) ; window . ftypes = new array (  ) ;fnames[0]= ' email ' ;ftypes[0]= ' email ' ;fnames[1]= ' fname ' ;ftypes[1]= ' text ' ;fnames[2]= ' lname ' ;ftypes[2]= ' text ' ;} ( jquery )  ) ;var $mcj = jquery . noconflict ( true ) ;      
__label__9     new ministers: big news at home ,  indifference abroad - swi swissinfo . ch             the current federal council doing its best to go unnoticed ,  january 2018 .  ( © keystone  /  peter klaunzer )        the day after switzerland elected two new members of its seven-member cabinet ,  the gap between domestic excitement and international indifference is striking .  why ? ‘historic’ – the word bounced across a breathless swiss press on thursday after two women ,  viola amherd and karin keller-sutter ,  were resoundingly chosen by parliament to join the country’s seven-member government ,  the federal council . and historic it was ,  with the pair becoming just the eighth and ninth female ministers on a body that has hosted 110 men since 1848; a clear “triumph” for women ,  as the tages-anzeiger newspaper headlined ,  and a symbolic leap for a country often called out for its slow progress  ( women earned the right to vote in 1971 )  . all the fanfare and excitement ,  however ,  seems not to have crossed the alps .  although switzerland regularly garners international attention for its financial sector ,  economics ,  diplomacy and humanitarian issues ,  this time reaction from abroad has been minimal . the two new ministers launched switzerland into the top 10 countries worldwide for female representation in government ,  and such a reshuffle of the executive branch is a rarity .  yet a quick google news search for “switzerland federal council” on thursday brings up almost exclusively domestic results .  why ? + portraits of switzerland’s two newest federal councillorsperhaps it’s that beneath the surface ,  the political shift brought about by the election is at best unclear ,  if not negligible .  as highly competent but highly consensual figures ,  it’s difficult to say whether ,  or how ,  amherd and keller-sutter will tilt the balance towards any major change in government policy when they officially join on january 1 . nenad stojanovic ,  a political scientist from the university of geneva ,  says that the real shift in the federal council’s politics came in 2017 when new entrant ignazio cassis moved things towards the right .  amherd ,  a centrist ,  and keller-sutter ,  a right-leaning liberal ,  will keep the status quo among the seven “sages” intact ,  he said . the opaque and politicised selection process doesn ' t help either: candidates are first proposed by their party ,  then over several weeks questioned behind closed doors ,  before finally being chosen by plenary ,  all in a somewhat cloak-and-dagger manner .  candidates rarely have international profiles ,  and rarely make shock statements that might attract attention . if we do have some sense of where they stand on key issues – keller-sutter has declared a tough line on asylum and eu negotiations ,  while amherd is more cagey and consensual about relations with brussels – candidates also need to tick the right boxes and dampen any fears that they might throw a spanner in the smooth workings of swiss stability . so should the world care more ?  maybe the question is whether switzerland should care if the world doesn’t care .  the neue zürcher zeitung newspaper wrote in its lead reaction on thursday that “boringness is a sign of stable political systems ,  and one of switzerland’s greatest assets” .  if the world chooses not to notice ,  perhaps it’s not a bad thing .        let ' s make a deal  switzerland faces stark choice on eu integration deal        swissinfo . ch         sign up for our free newsletters and get the top stories delivered to your inbox .    #mc_embed_signup div . response { margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em  . 5em  . 5em 0; font-weight: bold; float: left; top: -1 . 5em; z-index: 1; width: 80%;} label { display: inline; }    / * add your own mailchimp form style overrides in your site stylesheet or in this style block .  we recommend moving this block and the preceding css link to the head of your html file .  * /       email address     top stories  ( weekly )  latest news  ( daily )  business  ( weekly )  politics  ( weekly )  society  ( weekly )  fintech  ( biweekly )  multinationals  ( biweekly )  click here to see more newsletters              ( function ( $ )  {window . fnames = new array (  ) ; window . ftypes = new array (  ) ;fnames[0]= ' email ' ;ftypes[0]= ' email ' ;fnames[1]= ' fname ' ;ftypes[1]= ' text ' ;fnames[2]= ' lname ' ;ftypes[2]= ' text ' ;} ( jquery )  ) ;var $mcj = jquery . noconflict ( true ) ;      
__label__9     two women for government: who are switzerland’s new ministers ?  - swi swissinfo . ch             keller-sutter and amherd ,  in mutual congratulations on wednesday .  ( © keystone  /  anthony anex )        on wednesday morning ,  karin keller-sutter and viola amherd were elected to switzerland’s seven-member executive body – who are the new federal councillors ? after months of debates around gender ,  geography ,  language skills ,  and a healthy dose of party politics ,  the race to replace two outgoing federal councillors – ministers ,  in other words – came to an end in parliament on wednesday . the clear winners ,  who will become just the eighth and ninth women to sit in government since 1848 ,  are radical-liberal karin keller-sutter  ( who replaces johann schneider-ammann )  and christian democrat viola amherd  ( replacing doris leuthard )  .        cabinet elections  viola amherd and karin keller-sutter elected to government      from interpreter to ministerwho are they ?  gender ,  approximate age ,  competency ,  and a concern for the environment link the two ,  according to nenad stojanovic of the university of geneva .  but aside from this ,  their political profiles  ( keller-sutter on the right ,  amherd in the centre )  differ . keller-sutter ,  a 54-year-old trained translator from canton st gallen ,  was tipped from the start to take her party’s government seat . elected to the senate in 2011 after more than a decade spent directing the police and justice department of her home canton ,  keller-sutter has since won admiration at national level for her competence ,  as well as a less-reported penchant for graft: “you can call me after work today ,  i work until 11pm anyway” ,  she once told a journalist during her st gallen tenure . a bilingual french and german speaker ,  keller-sutter sits on the more conservative end of her party’s spectrum .  according to a 2015 survey ,  she holds tough positions on questions including citizenship laws ,  parental leave ,  and transparency in party financing; she is also known across switzerland as a hardliner on asylum issues . previously ,  in 2010 ,  she was also in the running to be selected as federal councillor before being pipped to the post by her outgoing radical-liberal colleague johann schneider-ammann . what changed in her favour in the interim ?  as well as the political timing being better for a woman from eastern switzerland ,  keller-sutter has consolidated and managed her public image skilfully ,  appealing across the spectrum ,  while also building up extensive contacts and a reputation for consensus within parliament . and she is endowed with a tenacity that ,  along with a modesty retained from years working as a conference interpreter ,  has won her respect and reputation .  “i don’t want to be muzzled ,  like my dog ! ” she told the nzz newspaper during the campaign .  more recently ,  she has also commented on the fixation on gender during the election campaign ,  telling public broadcaster srf: “i don’t just want to be a woman . ”keller-sutter has been involved in politics for two-and-a-half-decades ,  having been elected for the first time to the local parliament of wil in 1992 ,  at the age of 28 .                  magic formula  how are swiss federal councillors elected ?       viola amherd – legal expertfrom the centrist christian democrats ,  meanwhile ,  where the race was expected to be tighter than among the radical-liberals ,  viola amherd from canton valais was also resoundingly elected by parliament after just one round of voting . the 56-year-old independent solicitor ,  who describes herself as a big fan of mountain hiking ,  has been a parliamentarian since 2005 ,  and is well known at the federal level where she is often described as “discrete” . she is “very centrist ,  looks for consensus ,  and can build bridges” ,  said social democrat parliamentarian jacques-andré maire .  “she is very open on the societal level ,  as well as being outward-looking ,  and she has said that she’s keen to reach agreement with the eu” . overall ,  her profile is indeed rather centrist ,  though her positions vary on some key current debates ,  according to a 2015 smartvote poll: liberal when it comes to adoption rights for homosexual couples ,  as well as promoting large-scale building of renewable-energy infrastructure ,  she is nevertheless opposed to an extension of the carbon tax and proposals to legalise cannabis . like keller-sutter ,  she has links to business ,  and sits on the executive board of the gsmn group of private clinics ,  as well as railway companies bls and the matterhorn gotthard bahn .  she is also linked with several companies developing fibre-optic networks . amherd was a member of the government of her home municipality of brig-glis from 1992 to 2012 .  her victory on wednesday comes at the expense of heidi z’graggen ,  whose profile soared in recent weeks but whose lack of national experience ultimately meant she was unable to muster enough support to become the first ever federal councillor from canton uri . amherd takes the seat following the resignation of the popular and charismatic doris leuthard ,  who spent 12 successful years on the federal council .  her christian democrat party ,  which has lost some support in recent years and has sometimes suffered from internal divisions ,  will be hoping that amherd’s profile will help them rebound in time for national elections next year ,  where they are expected to emerge as one of the biggest losers . both keller-sutter and amherd – whose portfolios will be announced sometime after today’s election – will take up their posts on january 1 ,  2019 .           government shake-up  women in the federal council – a history                                                         adapted from input by balz rigendinger ,  marie vuilleumier & srf         sign up for our free newsletters and get the top stories delivered to your inbox .    #mc_embed_signup div . response { margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em  . 5em  . 5em 0; font-weight: bold; float: left; top: -1 . 5em; z-index: 1; width: 80%;} label { display: inline; }    / * add your own mailchimp form style overrides in your site stylesheet or in this style block .  we recommend moving this block and the preceding css link to the head of your html file .  * /       email address     top stories  ( weekly )  latest news  ( daily )  business  ( weekly )  politics  ( weekly )  society  ( weekly )  fintech  ( biweekly )  multinationals  ( biweekly )  click here to see more newsletters              ( function ( $ )  {window . fnames = new array (  ) ; window . ftypes = new array (  ) ;fnames[0]= ' email ' ;ftypes[0]= ' email ' ;fnames[1]= ' fname ' ;ftypes[1]= ' text ' ;fnames[2]= ' lname ' ;ftypes[2]= ' text ' ;} ( jquery )  ) ;var $mcj = jquery . noconflict ( true ) ;      
__label__1     switzerland faces stark choice on eu integration deal - swi swissinfo . ch             swiss president alain berset  ( centre )  will lead the government meeting on friday .  ( © keystone  /  peter klaunzer )        the swiss government on friday faces a stark choice on its future relations with the eu that is likely to resonate far beyond its borders — particularly in brexit britain . the seven-member federal council ,  or cabinet ,  of the non-eu member state must decide whether to accept a new “institutional framework” agreement with brussels ,  under which the swiss would adopt many eu rules automatically . it will be a decision fraught with tension .  as brexit approaches in the uk ,  the eu wants to recalibrate relations with “third party” countries — nations that have close ties to the bloc but are not members .  the swiss cabinet must choose whether to accept a deal that would align the affluent alpine country even closer with the eu and ,  in critics’ eyes ,  undermine the country’s independence . swiss recalcitrance could trigger penalties: brussels has “weaponised” interactions with non-eu financial institutions by threatening action against switzerland’s stock exchange .     div . edged { padding-bottom: 0 ! important; }    why is switzerland under pressure ? swiss-eu relations are based on more than 120 bilateral contracts negotiated since a 1992 referendum in the alpine state rejected joining the european economic area ,  a stepping stone to eu membership .  however ,  brussels sees the current package as highly accommodating towards the swiss — and based on the premise that switzerland would eventually join the eu .  since the uk voted for brexit ,  brussels has been determined that switzerland should not become a model for third country relationships .  over the past four years ,  brussels has pushed for a new arrangement with switzerland that would see swiss rules changing automatically to be in line with eu law ,  and the european court of justice  ( ecj )  having a role in resolving disputes .  with next year bringing european parliamentary elections and a new european commission team ,  jean-claude juncker ,  commission president ,  needs a deal in the coming weeks . what could happen on friday ? bern might appear to face a binary choice: either accept or reject the eu’s proposals ,  as negotiated .  but it could find wriggle room .  given the controversial status of the negotiated deal in switzerland ,  the federal council might argue for a public consultation period .  another option would be to protest that brexit is creating too much uncertainty over the eu’s future relationship with third countries .  “they could justifiably say that this is not the moment to push this through , ” said one bern insider . what are the dangers of no agreement ? brussels has warned that it could revoke the legal status of equivalence for the swiss equities market ,  europe’s fourth largest ,  at the end of the year .  without equivalence ,  eu institutions could only access swiss shares such as nestlé and novartis via local brokers ,  and swiss investors would need to go through eu banks and brokers to buy and sell stock in companies such as deutsche bank ,  total or telefónica .  that could raise overall share trading costs for ordinary investors . “it’s not a pretty position for either side to be in , ” said alasdair haynes ,  chief executive of aquis exchange ,  a eu share trading venue .  “the pan-european marketplace we’ve been trying to develop for 10 years will take a significant negative impact . ”longer term ,  switzerland could find access to eu research programmes more difficult ,  while future market access deals ,  especially for its banks ,  would be put on hold . what are the ramifications for brexit ? the political weaponising of what should be a technical decision about equivalence sets a potentially worrying precedent for the uk’s financial sector ,  which is likely face a similar regime post-brexit .  more broadly ,  switzerland and the uk are different in size and geography .  but both countries are having to address the trade-offs involved in being outside the bloc . why are the swiss resisting a framework agreement ? the biggest points of dispute centre on swiss rules protecting local high wages and the costs of switzerland accepting the eu’s cherished principle of the free movement of people .  there are also objections to the role of the ecj and eu rules on state aid ,  which could affect publicly guaranteed swiss cantonal banks .  + putting the institutional framework agreement in contexta deal would almost certainly be put to a referendum ,  where it is likely to be resisted fiercely by the nationalist swiss people’s party   ( svp )  ,  the country’s most popular political party .  svp politicians warn against switzerland accepting eu “colony” status — and point to the economic leverage bern could have over brussels ,  for instance ,  if it threatened big increases in charges for trans-alpine freight transport .  how useful a weapon is equivalence ? brussels’ tactics have the advantage of flexibility .  last year ,  the european commission waited until december 21 before announcing that equivalence for the swiss stock exchange would be extended only until the end of this month .  in theory ,  decisions are meant to be based on careful consultation with national governments but brussels insiders say this scrutiny could be truncated to as few as five days ,  and done by written procedures .  so brussels could again keep bern dangling until just days before christmas . the swiss however ,  have made contingency plans .  last friday ,  bern put in place rules that could ,  if necessary ,  prevent eu venues from trading swiss company shares .  the idea is that would drive trade back to the swiss exchange ,  providing a compensating income stream .  how effective this would be is not clear . beyond that ,  bern could consider legal action against brussels ,  arguing unfair discrimination compared with the treatment of other non-eu exchanges . arguably more importantly for friday’s decision ,  swiss politicians resent what they regard as “blackmail” by brussels ,  and may decide the price for swiss equity markets is worth paying ,  given reservations about the proposed institutional framework .  the swiss are globally renowned as expert negotiators — and will fight to protect their interests . copyright the financial times limited 2018       ch-eu  swiss act to protect swiss stock exchange               sign up for our free newsletters and get the top stories delivered to your inbox .    #mc_embed_signup div . response { margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em  . 5em  . 5em 0; font-weight: bold; float: left; top: -1 . 5em; z-index: 1; width: 80%;} label { display: inline; }    / * add your own mailchimp form style overrides in your site stylesheet or in this style block .  we recommend moving this block and the preceding css link to the head of your html file .  * /       email address     top stories  ( weekly )  latest news  ( daily )  business  ( weekly )  politics  ( weekly )  society  ( weekly )  fintech  ( biweekly )  multinationals  ( biweekly )  click here to see more newsletters              ( function ( $ )  {window . fnames = new array (  ) ; window . ftypes = new array (  ) ;fnames[0]= ' email ' ;ftypes[0]= ' email ' ;fnames[1]= ' fname ' ;ftypes[1]= ' text ' ;fnames[2]= ' lname ' ;ftypes[2]= ' text ' ;} ( jquery )  ) ;var $mcj = jquery . noconflict ( true ) ;

"if you agree to this ,  it will never stop , " said senator andrea caroni of the centre-right free democratic party  ( fdp )  ,  during the debate .  he rhetorically asked whether discrimination against disabled people ,  linguistic regions ,  nationalities or political opinion should also be included in the law . lgbtiq organisations welcomed the extension of the anti-racism penal standard ,  but regretted the decision that "excludes and further marginalises intersexuals and transsexuals" .  "[the law] will only be complete when it condemns discrimination based on gender identity , " said alecs recher ,  a lawyer with transgender network switzerland  ( tgns )  . politician mathias reynard ,  the author of the parliamentary motion ,  told the 24 heures newspaper that "it is difficult to go further with the current parliament" .  he added that "according to some lawyers ,  this law can also be used in the case of a transphobic attack" and that the courts could interpret it broadly . the centre-left social democrats prefer to see "the glass half full" than empty .

( keystone  /  anthony anex )        over 40°c in the cities ,  long periods of drought and little snow in winter: in forty years’ time ,  switzerland might look like one of the mediterranean countries today .  what effect would this have on society ,  tourism in the alps ,  and the environment ? "today the mercury hit 45 degrees in geneva .  the swiss plateau and the alpine valleys had their twentieth day of tropical weather since the year started .  the heatwave gripping the south side of the alps and valais for the past month will continue on into the coming weeks .  due to the ongoing drought ,  people are being asked to keep water consumption to a minimum . "by the year 2060 ,  it could be the typical national weather forecast on a summer’s day .  this is based on new climate scenarios for switzerland devised by meteoswiss ,  the federal department of meteorology and climatology ,  and the federal institute of technology in zurich  ( ethz )  ,  published in mid-november .  "switzerland will be a hotter and a drier place , ” summarised peter binder ,  the head of meteoswiss .        change in average summer temperature in switzerland compared to 1981-2010 .  the trend without climate protection measures is red ,  the forecasts with immediate emission reduction measures are blue .  ( swissinfo . ch )        to get an idea of the kind of climate likely in switzerland in the second half of the current century ,  it is enough to look at what happened this year ,  says christoph schär ,  a climatologist at the zurich-based institution .  "the 2018 heatwave was a warning for the future .  the extremes we are seeing at the present time could become the norm by 2060 . "from alpine glaciers to life in the major cities ,  swissinfo . ch takes a look at the likely effects of global warming – assuming that appeals for a drastic reduction of emissions continue fall on deaf ears . smaller glaciers disappearsince 1850 the 1 , 500 or so swiss glaciers have lost 60% of their volume .  in the hot summer of 2018 alone ,  the loss amounted to 2 . 5% .  because of rising temperatures and less snow in the springtime ,  smaller glaciers are doomed ,  says matthias huss ,  a glaciologist at eth .  according to the federal environment ministry ,  only the ones in the highest parts of the bernese alps and valais will survive ,  such as the aletsch glacier . the shrinking mass of the ice ,  as well as having an adverse effect on the landscape and on the stability of mountainsides ,  will also have repercussions on the water supply system .  based on current knowledge from climate scenarios of 2011 ,  olivier overney ,  who heads the hydrology division of the federal environment ministry ,  says that "climate change will mean important changes to water resources at the local level . ” the new climate scenarios need to be combined with the hydrological models to yield more precise data ,  he adds . the retreat of the glaciers will make a major difference to europe’s great rivers which rise in the swiss alps .  according to predictions ,  the volume of the rhone could be down 40% in the coming years . alpine tourismin future there will still be winters with heavy snow .  they will just happen less frequently .  people who want to ski at the high-altitude ski resorts like zermatt or st moritz will have to expect 30-60% less snow cover than today .  ski resorts at around 1 , 500 metres will lose about 100 days of snow . in adelboden ,  at 1 , 350 metres ,  there will be less snow days than there are now in the capital city of berne  ( 542 metres )  ,  say forecasters from the federal institute for forest ,  snow and landscape research and the federal institute of technology in lausanne . for some time now ,  tourist resorts have been offering summer and autumn aimed at reducing their dependence on winter tourism ,  says bruno galliker ,  a spokesman for the industry association of ski-lift operators .  in switzerland ,  however ,  he is at pains to point out ,  winter sports are not on the way out .  "in the coming decades it will still be possible to ski in switzerland ,  especially using man-made snow .  switzerland has a competitive advantage over neighbouring countries ,  because the skiing areas are at higher altitudes . "                  white carpet  skiing on preserved snow      according to galliker ,  climate change could even have a silver lining for alpine tourism .  "fascinating new landscapes will appear .  the rising heat down in the valleys will drive people to go up the mountains to cool off in more pleasant temperatures" ,  he claims . oak to replace spruceglobal warming will cause existing vegetation zones to shift upwards by 500-700 metres ,  researchers believe .  in the alps ,  deciduous trees like oaks and maples will take the place of conifers .  the spruce ,  the most important tree for the swiss forest industry ,  is likely to disappear from the swiss plateau due to exposure to harmful organisms like the bark beetle . according to the experts ,  it will be crucial to foster diversity of trees ,  because a natural forest with a high degree of biodiversity is better able to resist hot summers and rainy winters .  here you can see how foresters are getting ready for the forest of the future . marco conedera ,  a forest engineer with the institute for forest ,  snow and landscape research ,  warns that "rising temperatures ,  and less snow lower down ,  will add to the risk of forest fires" .  in particular ,  it could mean that fires started by lightning strikes could become more frequent and more dangerous .  these are hard to get under control because they affect mountain conifers in out-of-the way areas .  "another tendency we see happening already is high-risk fire season lasting into autumn and winter too" ,  explains conedera . biodiversity in declinebiodiversity in switzerland is in poor shape at the moment ,  with 36% of all animal ,  plant and mushroom species on the endangered list ,  points out urs tester of the pro natura organisation .  with  global warming ,  the situation is only going to get worse .

"switzerland will have to focus on solar power ,  which is now the cheapest technology for production of electricity .  it has the potential to produce double the power produced by nuclear plants today" ,  says nipkow . islands of heat in the citybecause the ground is closed up and heat is being produced by traffic ,  industries and buildings ,  temperatures in the city are a few degrees higher than in the hinterland; in the case of zurich ,  differences of over 4°c have been measured .  warmer summers are likely to turn cities into veritable hothouses . to tackle this problem ,  cities will need more green and open spaces ,  exercise control over the colour and the thermic properties of buildings and improve air circulation - for example by setting limits for building height and density .  the federal government is sponsoring projects on adapting to climate change ,  including one in sion ,  canton valais - the swiss city that has warmed up the most .           sion  the climatic metamorphosis of a city                                              more heatwave deaths ? heatwaves are a major threat for switzerland ,  says the federal health ministry .  most vulnerable are the elderly and infirm .  during the long hot summer of 2003 ,  prolonged temperatures of over 30°c caused about 1 , 000 premature deaths in switzerland ,  and 70 , 000 in europe . higher temperatures also favour the spread of infectious diseases previously confined to the tropics .  in switzerland there is concern about the spread of the asiatic tiger mosquito ,  which could become a carrier of dengue fever or chikungunya .  hot summers also favour the spread of ticks ,  which are liable to be carrying meningitis and lyme disease .  the map below shows the current high-risk areas . a different switzerland is possiblethis may all seem like a doomsday scenario .  but whereas global emissions are still rising ,  it is still possible to reverse the trend and avoid the worst eventualities ,  say the un’s climate experts . reto knutti ,  a climate researcher at ethz ,  emphasises that a concerted effort would pay off .

( epa file )        the uk’s financial regulator has urged a group of international banks in the city of london to limit the number of clients they move overseas as part of their brexit preparations . the financial conduct authority wrote to the banks last week warning them to make “the minimum necessary changes” to where their clients are based .  it said it was “prepared to intervene where we see steps being taken which could expose clients or markets to unacceptable execution risks” .     div . edged { padding-bottom: 0 ! important; }    in the letter ,  first reported by financial news ,  the fca added that it expected the banks to concentrate on “day one readiness” for brexit and to limit disruption “to avoid harm to the clients they serve or markets in which they operate” .  it added: “clients should not be moved out of the uk until the fca is satisfied that the relevant uk boards and / or senior managers have fully considered the impact of their firms’ proposals on every category of client ,  including whether their proposed changes are in each client’s best interests . ”swiss bankerone person at a swiss bank said it had received similar inquiries from the regulator previously “asking about what client business we are planning to move away from the uk  .   .   .  which seems to be a focus from the fca at the moment” . they thought it was “more aimed at those without a subsidiary structure in the uk or on the continent already” . one us bank said the bank of england “is being very accommodating about us needing to move eu clients” . as for non-eu clients ,  the fca said the uk would have a post-brexit regulatory framework that delivered “equivalent outcomes to the eu27” and so moving them out of the uk could expose them to differing contractual ,  insolvency and tax regimes .  this could also spell “increased costs and risks to which they would otherwise not be exposed” ,  the watchdog added .  “where firms are looking to make changes  .   .   .  which may impact non-eu 27 clients ,  they should discuss those plans with us . ” the letter was signed by megan butler ,  the fca’s executive director for supervision . the regulator said: “we have emphasised to firms that we expect decisions taken by them in relation to eu withdrawal to be consistent with our statutory objectives ,  which include the interests of their clients . ” alternative hubsthe big banks have been stepping up their brexit planning ,  setting up alternative european hubs in places such as paris ,  frankfurt and dublin .  they have also been increasing the amounts they are spending on brexit preparations and are sticking to a march 2019 timeframe despite government plans for a transition . andrew bailey ,  the fca’s chief executive ,  denied the move was politically motivated ,  telling the treasury select committee it was entirely consistent with the regulator’s objectives . “we didn’t do this to say ,  ‘nobody must leave the uk , ’” he said .  institutions might well be under pressure to “do a big jigsaw puzzle” in order to make operations more self-sufficient ,  but “if you are considering moving non-european business ,  then you have to make those decisions in the interests of the client” . the issue might well “rumble on” ,  he added ,  because eu authorities would accept firms doing the minimum needed for a smooth transition immediately after brexit ,  but the “day two discussion” would be about what a sustainable business on the continent would look like . copyright the financial times limited 2018         sign up for our free newsletters and get the top stories delivered to your inbox .    #mc_embed_signup div . response { margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em  . 5em  . 5em 0; font-weight: bold; float: left; top: -1 . 5em; z-index: 1; width: 80%;} label { display: inline; }    / * add your own mailchimp form style overrides in your site stylesheet or in this style block .  we recommend moving this block and the preceding css link to the head of your html file .  * /       email address     top stories  ( weekly )  latest news  ( daily )  business  ( weekly )  politics  ( weekly )  society  ( weekly )  fintech  ( biweekly )  multinationals  ( biweekly )  click here to see more newsletters              ( function ( $ )  {window . fnames = new array (  ) ; window . ftypes = new array (  ) ;fnames[0]= ' email ' ;ftypes[0]= ' email ' ;fnames[1]= ' fname ' ;ftypes[1]= ' text ' ;fnames[2]= ' lname ' ;ftypes[2]= ' text ' ;} ( jquery )  ) ;var $mcj = jquery . noconflict ( true ) ;

( © keystone  /  peter klaunzer )        as switzerland unveil its two newest federal councillors ,  we asked readers ,  experts ,  and politicians what kind of skills are needed to lead a modern democracy . what makes a leader ?  is it a question of qualification ,  connection ,  temperament ,  or simple political serendipity ? switzerland has been mulling the question for some months now ,  as it prepares to learn on wednesday the names of the two federal councillors that will replace outgoing johann schneider-ammann and doris leuthard .  both declared their departure from the executive body in september . in the consensus-driven alpine nation ,  at least ,  some requirements are more prosaic than others .  firstly ,  to preserve the so-called “magic formula” that safeguards balance in the seven-member federal council ,  the two new ministers will be drawn from the same political groups as their predecessors – the centre-right liberal-radicals and christian democrats . then there is the issue of origin .  switzerland’s diverse cultural-linguistic regions tend to cling tightly to ministers when they get one .  leuthard and schneider-ammann are both germanophones ,  which somewhat simplifies matters .  as does the selection process: parliament decides based on party recommendations . add to this the growing calls – both from the public and from the political establishment – for more female representation ,  as well as eagerness for young blood in an ageing cabinet ,  and the pool of candidates shrinks almost to the point of inevitability . your saybut what about candidates’ personal qualifications and qualities ?  does the country rather need lawyers at the helm  ( the us model ,  traditionally )  ,  or more technically-minded leaders  ( à la china )  ?  more scientists or tech wizards for the digital age ?  a healthy helping of gravitas ?  multilinguals  ( including english )  ? when we put the question to swissinfo . ch followers on social media ,  answers varied widely .  a couple of readers ,  fed up with a perceived dominance of lawyers and political types ,  called for more scientists: “they’re closest to reality”; “it would be good to have a person that understands energy and environmental problems ,  who could provide some solutions” .     as switzerland searches for two new government ministers ,  we want to know what skills a 21st-century politician needs .  do we want a lawyer ,  a businessperson ,  a scientist ,  or just somebody with common sense ?  share your answer & it may appear in an upcoming article .  pic . twitter . com / temv5ovuog— swissinfo . ch  ( @swissinfo_en )  november 4 ,  2018   business people ,  sometimes seen as examples of pragmatic “real-world” problem solvers that are lacking in government ,  were alternately lauded  ( “someone who has worked at least 10 years for private business” )  and decried  ( “definitely not a businessman; it’s not working so well for the us” )  . the issue of age  ( “at least 45” )  ,  tech savviness  ( we live in a “whole new environment” )  ,  and the competence to grasp and manage complex dossiers without getting bogged down in details also featured .  one reader suggested that roger federer become more than just a figurative king . character countsbeyond the debate about qualifications ,  backgrounds ,  and cvs ,  however ,  the simple quality of possessing “common sense” was far and away the most prevalent reader recommendation .  one person even contrasted this directly with the seemingly undesirable status of having “too many degrees” .  political scientist claude longchamp ,  of research institute gfs . bern ,  agrees with this sentiment ,  though he arrives at a slightly different conclusion .  for the veteran analyst ,  who has seen the transformation of the typical swiss politician from locally-driven “man of the people” to today’s more multifaceted leader ,  qualifications and expertise come second to gravitas .        government elections  ‘helvetia is calling ! ’ is she being heard ?      “a federal councillor should be able to represent switzerland with gravitas , ” he argues .  he or she ,  says longchamp ,  should be able to go beyond the “mere” ability to manage a dossier to demonstrate the stature and charisma of a statesman ,  or woman .  current federal councillor alain berset has such qualities; karin keller-sutter ,  widely tipped to succeed schneider-ammann ,  does too . this analysis might seem vague coming from a political scientist ,  a profession that often distils the minutiae of public life into rationalised and precise divisions .  after all ,  you can’t quantify charisma .  but this is the point .  the intangible truth of leadership involves equal parts persuasion ,  knowledge ,  humility and confidence ,  beyond the measurable . it also reflects swiss particularities .  federal councillors are not like ministers in other european countries ,  longchamp emphasises .  elsewhere – in france ,  for example – ministers can be specialists in charge of specific dossiers .  here ,  federal departments are broad amalgamations of topics suiting wide-ranging generalists . generalists wantedlongchamp also notes as important the ability to overcome party-specific affiliations to serve the common  ( national )  good ,  something of which current president alain berset is again a positive example .  it’s more difficult for politicians coming from extreme positions on the political spectrum than for traditional centrists . thirty-year-old lisa mazzone ,  a green party politician from geneva ,  was until recently the youngest member of the house of representatives .   ( she was dethroned by 28-year-old fabian molina last year )  . mazzone is not in the running for federal councillor and says that she wouldn’t particularly want to be .  but what “type” of politician would she like to see sitting on the executive body ?        lisa mazzone addressing the house of representatives ,  june 2018 .  ( © keystone  /  anthony anex )        the geneva politician ,  who herself studied french and latin literature ,  avoids putting much emphasis on technical qualification or background .  “it’s more important to be a generalist , ” she says .  key skills ,  she believes ,  are the ability to understand a dossier quickly and effectively explain it to a media-saturated public without oversimplifying the issues .   she also echoes longchamp ,  and our readers ,  in noting that temperament trumps almost everything .  she cites “people skills” ,  a true “grounding in swiss values” ,  and a commitment to “transcending party divisions” to act in the interest of the nation as the most important qualities in a leader . there has been a recent increase in so-called “professional politicians” who enter full-time politics without having previously carved out a career in another field .  mazzone ,  who technically fits that description ,  is reluctant to say whether such politicians are better or worse suited for leadership ,  though some critics claim they are divorced from citizens’ real lives . she admits some of her colleagues are perhaps more interested in “being” politicians rather than “doing” politics ,  but her goals and motivations are clear . “i entered politics because i wanted to change society , ” she says .        council of seven  how switzerland chooses new cabinet ministers        swissinfo . ch         sign up for our free newsletters and get the top stories delivered to your inbox .    #mc_embed_signup div . response { margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em  . 5em  . 5em 0; font-weight: bold; float: left; top: -1 . 5em; z-index: 1; width: 80%;} label { display: inline; }    / * add your own mailchimp form style overrides in your site stylesheet or in this style block .  we recommend moving this block and the preceding css link to the head of your html file .  * /       email address     top stories  ( weekly )  latest news  ( daily )  business  ( weekly )  politics  ( weekly )  society  ( weekly )  fintech  ( biweekly )  multinationals  ( biweekly )  click here to see more newsletters              ( function ( $ )  {window . fnames = new array (  ) ; window . ftypes = new array (  ) ;fnames[0]= ' email ' ;ftypes[0]= ' email ' ;fnames[1]= ' fname ' ;ftypes[1]= ' text ' ;fnames[2]= ' lname ' ;ftypes[2]= ' text ' ;} ( jquery )  ) ;var $mcj = jquery . noconflict ( true ) ;      
__label__11     racism in switzerland:  an expat’s perspective - swi swissinfo . ch             a race against racism ,  held for the 17th time in zurich in september .  ( keystone )        an african-american woman living in switzerland shares her and her children ' s everyday experiences with racism .         ( swissinfo . ch )        i personally have experienced the swiss to be polite ,  cheerful ,  helpful and willing ,  when possible ,  to speak to me in english when my basic swiss german fails me .   i feel more the burden of being a foreigner who doesn’t speak the native language than the burden of racism .   but most of the swiss i interact with are merchants ,  and being nice is an important part of the job description .         christine worrell is an american expat who has lived in switzerland with her family for five years .   a mother of two and a former corporate lawyer ,  she currently sits on three charitable boards in switzerland .   she enjoys travel ,  reading and cooking .   she is fluent in italian ,  and continues to attempt to learn german !  ( christine worrell )        although my pre-teen / teen daughter and son attend international school ,  they take public transport ,  travel to other parts of switzerland for sports tournaments ,  and socialize with swiss kids .   they are much more integrated in swiss society than i am .   and they have been victimized because of their race .  i will never forget the tearful outrage of my son when he told me of his first experience of racism ,  which happened in switzerland .   he had been walking to the lake to meet some friends when a woman clutched her purse and crossed the street to avoid walking near him .   my funny ,  smart ,  angelic faced boy was viewed as someone to be avoided ,  someone who was a threat ,  someone who didn’t belong because of the color of his skin .    the thing about racist treatment is that even though as a person of color you are always on the alert for it ,  it somehow always seems to take you by surprise .   i blamed myself for not having had “the talk” with my son that every black parent has to have to prepare their child for the day they will be perceived negatively and / or treated differently because of their skin color .   i somehow thought i had more time ,  or that everyone who looked at my handsome boy would see him for what he truly was – a great kid .   i remember explaining to him that day that the shame of racism is on the person who commits the racist act and not on the person subjected to racism .   i explained that racism derived from either hatred or ignorance ,  and that we should pity people with hatred in their hearts or ignorant minds .  bus driver incidentthe next time something more seriously racist happened to him ,  i was in a position to address the incident .   he had been waiting for the public bus at the bus stop near his school ,  which also serves a nearby refugee center .   even though he signaled ,  the bus driver didn’t stop and laughed while giving my son the middle finger as he passed him by .   fueled by my fury and the desire to teach him that it is important in life to stand up to unacceptable behavior ,  i contacted the school and the bus company and made a complaint .   thankfully ,  i was taken seriously by both organizations .   they met with us ,  an investigation was made ,  and the bus driver was fired .   it turns out that this was the last in a string of infractions by him .   though i was angry that a bus driver with a history of inappropriate behavior could continue to be employed and given a route driving children ,  i was happy with the resolution of the matter .   but i often wonder if my brown-skinned boy had actually been the refugee child he was probably taken to be and had he not had the benefit of an international school backing his claim ,  the incident would have been taken seriously and the outcome the same .   i’ll never know .  my daughter has not been immune to negative experiences although she is a girl .   she was once pushed down to the floor by a swiss boy and called a “nigger” while standing on a public bus .   she had had no interaction with this boy prior to being assaulted and was merely chatting with her friend .   luckily ,  her friend spoke fluent german and while my daughter told him off in english ,  her friend did so in german .   i was proud of her for standing up to a racist bully ,  but also fearful that the next time  ( for i am certain there will be a next time )  she might be alone and the boy might not be willing to stand down .  lack of equal accessas a result of immigration ,  switzerland is becoming more racially diverse .   there are estimated to be approximately 100 , 000 black people currently living in switzerland .   switzerland has a unique opportunity to learn from the mistakes of the us ,  with its toxic racial history ,  and from its european neighbors ,  many of which have failed to successfully integrate significant african and arab immigrant populations and failed to educate the native-born population about tolerance and acceptance .   the swiss government is taking steps to understand the issue of racism in switzerland ,  which is a first step in addressing it .   a study by the swiss federal commission against racism found that black people in switzerland do not have equal access to public services ,  housing ,  employment or the protection of the judicial system and are often subject to racial profiling by authorities .   despite these findings ,  in a 2017 survey ,  51% of swiss viewed racism towards blacks as a minor problem .  racism exists in many places ,  not least in my home country of the u . s .  ,  but racism anywhere is a societal ill that should be tamped down ,  stamped out and not allowed to take root because like a weed it will flourish and thrive to the detriment of society .   one of the recommendations of the european commission against racism and intolerance  ( ecri )  of the council of europe ,  of which switzerland is a member ,  is that racism cannot be combatted without the engagement of a “civil society . ”  a top-down approach has little chance of success ,  but the engagement of citizens is crucial .   it also views surveying the discriminatory experiences and perceptions of potential victims of racism as crucial to understanding and combating the problem .   it is against this backdrop that i share my account .   i feel it is important to share my family’s stories ,  perspective and experiences to create better understanding of what it is like to be black and brown and living in switzerland .  my daughter just returned to switzerland from a school trip to tanzania .   when my husband asked her what part of her trip made the biggest impression on her ,  her response surprised us .   she said that she was struck by how happy and joyful the people were .   they had very little and yet they were kind and generous and welcoming to the international students who came to visit them and to learn about their culture .   wouldn’t it be wonderful if switzerland could treat newcomers of all races with the same spirit of openness and acceptance ?         indian student blog  racism exists ,  even

__label__9     switzerland likes to tax differently from europe - swi swissinfo . ch             filling out tax returns is a headache for many swiss taxpayers .  ( keystone )        from january 1 ,  2019 ,  switzerland will be the only country in europe where employees’ taxes are not deducted directly from their wages .  despite numerous parliamentary initiatives ,  switzerland is not yet ready to introduce withholding tax . swiss taxpayers and foreigners who hold a c residence permit  ( longer-term stay )  must submit a tax return every year from which their taxation is calculated .  switzerland’s federal structure means that taxpayers pay a tax at national ,  cantonal and communal level .  the former is a direct federal tax levied by the cantons on behalf of the confederation .      taxes     in general ,  it is possible to pay cantonal and communal taxes in instalments over one year .  the number of instalments varies from canton to canton .  some even provide for a monthly payment or the possibility of paying everything at once .  at the end of the tax year ,  the administration calculates a final tax demand to determine whether these advance payments were sufficient to cover the bill – or not . the income of foreigners without a c permit is subject to withholding tax .  their employer deducts taxes directly from their monthly salary and pays this amount to the tax authorities . but there are exceptions .  in most cantons where french cross-border workers are employed  ( geneva is not one of them )  ,  they only have to declare and pay their taxes in their country of residence ,  so they are not subject to withholding tax .  the french state then transfers part of the tax to the swiss cantons and municipalities in which these commuters work . changes rejectedover the last century ,  the vast majority of industrialised countries have evolved from a so-called declaratory tax system to a withholding tax system .  in europe ,  germany was a pioneer in this field and adopted this system as early as 1925 . france and switzerland are the only countries that have not yet introduced withholding tax .  but france will switch to the new system from january 1 ,  2019 ,  a reform that has been carried out with great difficulty .  from that date ,  swiss workers will be the only ones on the continent not to have their pay slips reduced by income tax . in recent years ,  several parliamentary initiatives have been submitted with the aim of introducing withholding tax in switzerland - most recently this autumn .  but the idea was once again rejected by the government and is therefore unlikely to obtain parliamentary approval . the federal council  ( swiss government )  says withholding tax would represent an excessive administrative burden for companies ,  taxpayers and administrators ,  "especially if the workplace and residence are not in the same canton” . in a recently published study by collection agency intrum ,  the swiss rank as second worst payers on the european continent ,  just behind greece .  tax claims are cited as the main reason for late payments in switzerland . direct and automatic deductions of tax from wages would solve this problem to a large extent ,  say supporters of this withholding tax system .  taxpayers would know exactly how much money they had at their disposal without having to worry about their tax bills . withholding taxes would benefit those taxpayers who fulfil their civic financial obligations and ultimately lead to fewer tax losses for the state ,  they say .        not ok computer  tax system problems result in chf1 . 8bn shortfall        swissinfo . ch         sign up for our free newsletters and get the top stories delivered to your inbox .    #mc_embed_signup div . response { margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em  . 5em  . 5em 0; font-weight: bold; float: left; top: -1 . 5em; z-index: 1; width: 80%;} label { display: inline; }    / * add your own mailchimp form style overrides in your site stylesheet or in this style block .  we recommend moving this block and the preceding css link to the head of your html file .  * /       email address     top stories  ( weekly )  latest news  ( daily )  business  ( weekly )  politics  ( weekly )  society  ( weekly )  fintech  ( biweekly )  multinationals  ( biweekly )  click here to see more newsletters              ( function ( $ )  {window . fnames = new array (  ) ; window . ftypes = new array (  ) ;fnames[0]= ' email ' ;ftypes[0]= ' email ' ;fnames[1]= ' fname ' ;ftypes[1]= ' text ' ;fnames[2]= ' lname ' ;ftypes[2]= ' text ' ;} ( jquery )  ) ;var $mcj = jquery . noconflict ( true ) ;

( keystone )        three years after sealing a landmark global climate deal in paris ,  world leaders are gathering again in poland to agree on the fine print .  switzerland’s climate ambassador tells swissinfo . ch what to expect from the talks .  “we have to work hard ,  to keep the united states and brazil in ,  but at the same time we mustn’t compromise so much that we undo paris , ” franz perrez said .  “it’s a delicate balance . ” since the us announced its withdrawal from the paris agreement in 2017 ,  brazil’s nationalist president-elect ,  jair bolsonaro ,  has threatened to pull out as well .  on november 28 ,  the brazilian government said it would withdraw its offer to host next year’s critical climate summit ,  just two months after winning the hosting bid .  + why the swiss think the us is shooting itself in the foot over climate dealbrazil’s next foreign minister ,  ernesto araujo ,  has said climate change is part of a “marxist plot” and has criticised the paris agreement for failing to recognise the role of faith and patriotism .  but despite washington and brasilia’s positions ,  perrez warned that another growing split needs to be addressed at the 24th conference of the parties to the unfccc  ( cop24 )  in katowice .  he said some of the world’s biggest emitters ,  such as the so-called like-minded developing countries which include china ,  vietnam ,  malaysia and many oil-producing countries ,  were challenging rules intended to put countries on similar footing according to emissions capacity .  “if they do not engage ,  paris will fail , ” perrez said at a conference in geneva .  “they try to weaken the rules for themselves .  if we agree on a system that treats china in the same manner as ethiopia or the marshall islands ,  then i think paris has failed . ”+ tagging along with perrez at the un‘climate-friendly society’ with national contributions or emissions-cutting pledges set individually by countries ,  delegations meeting in the polish city from december 3-14 will have the task of setting mechanisms to verify climate actions and impose sanctions if targets are not met .  alain berset ,  who holds the rotating swiss presidency this year ,  will attend the opening of the summit with 45 other heads of state .  outgoing environment minister doris leuthard will participate in the session’s ministerial segment on december 12 ,  when ministers are expected to discuss national goals for emissions cuts .  according to bern’s official communiqué ,  the final “silesia declaration” which the cop24 plans to adopt “describes the action to be taken to achieve solidarity and a just transition to a climate-friendly society” .  last week ,  16 european states including switzerland signed a statement calling on all countries to increase the ambition of pledges made prior to the paris agreement .  in paris in 2015 ,  switzerland committed to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030 ,  compared with 1990 levels . assessment report in october ,  the un’s intergovernmental panel on climate change  ( ipcc )  published a report predicting that a rise in global temperatures of 2°c instead of 1 . 5°c would expose tens of millions more people to coastal flooding ,  water shortages and heat waves .  the ipcc’s impact assessment report called for a nearly 45% reduction in global emissions based on 2010 levels by 2030 .  meanwhile on november 27 ,  un environment’s emissions gap report noted that emissions rose in 2017 for the first time in four years and that they would need to peak in 2020 to achieve goals set by the paris agreement .  it also predicted that the world was set to see a 3 . 2°c rise in global temperatures by 2100 .        ipcc report  next decade ‘will be decisive’ for climate crisis        swissinfo . ch         sign up for our free newsletters and get the top stories delivered to your inbox .    #mc_embed_signup div . response { margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em  . 5em  . 5em 0; font-weight: bold; float: left; top: -1 . 5em; z-index: 1; width: 80%;} label { display: inline; }    / * add your own mailchimp form style overrides in your site stylesheet or in this style block .  we recommend moving this block and the preceding css link to the head of your html file .  * /       email address     top stories  ( weekly )  latest news  ( daily )  business  ( weekly )  politics  ( weekly )  society  ( weekly )  fintech  ( biweekly )  multinationals  ( biweekly )  click here to see more newsletters              ( function ( $ )  {window . fnames = new array (  ) ; window . ftypes = new array (  ) ;fnames[0]= ' email ' ;ftypes[0]= ' email ' ;fnames[1]= ' fname ' ;ftypes[1]= ' text ' ;fnames[2]= ' lname ' ;ftypes[2]= ' text ' ;} ( jquery )  ) ;var $mcj = jquery . noconflict ( true ) ;

__label__6     meet the swiss woman charged with bringing peace to myanmar - swi swissinfo . ch             un special envoy to myanmar christine schraner burgener has been travelling a lot ,  including to rakhine ,  from which nearly a million rohingya refugees have fled .   ( keystone )        how do you help a country from which nearly a million people have fled ,  where the government is divided between civilians and soldiers ,  and where top people are accused of genocide ?  this is the task facing christine schraner burgener of switzerland . she was appointed un special envoy on myanmar in april this year ,  and recently discussed her new role over coffee in bern .  she agreed to meet in the einstein café in the capital city’s picturesque old town .  it is cold outside ,  and she says yes ,  she is feeling the changes in temperature ,  especially after all her recent travelling . schraner burgener ,  55 ,  looks elegant in white ,  topped with a leather jacket .  she is swiss but grew up in japan .  she previously served as swiss ambassador to germany and thailand ,  where she pioneered a diplomatic job-share with her husband ,  enabling them to both look after their two children .  so she is swiss and a little bit asian ,  a champion of “female diplomacy” .  she plays the violin and saxophone ,  she says .  so maybe she is classic ,  with a little bit of jazz…now that the two children - a daughter of 22 and son of 19 - have grown up ,  she says she was ready to take this post .  but it is an enormous challenge .  is this the biggest challenge she has faced so far ?  each challenge is different ,  she explains:                           christine schraner burgener  "this time it’s different because i’m in the spotlight .  .  . "       the new un special envoy was appointed in the wake of an army crackdown in august 2017 against the muslim rohingya in myanmar’s rakhine state ,  after rohingya militants attacked police posts .  un reports say the army ,  sometimes helped by local buddhist militias ,  torched villages ,  committed mass killings ,  rape and sexual violence .  some 700 , 000 rohingya people fled to neighbouring bangladesh ,  where they now live in overcrowded refugee camps .  a recent un report said the country’s army chief and five other named top military officials should be prosecuted for genocide ,  crimes against humanity and war crimes . schraner burgener’s mandate is wide ,  she tells us .  it includes rakhine ,  the return of the refugees ,  promoting democracy and human rights ,  and the wider peace process .   myanmar also has longstanding ethnic conflicts in other states as well as rakhine .  but her priority ,  she says ,  is the nearly one million rohingya in the refugee camps ,  who need “an immediate solution” .  she says they must be allowed to return voluntarily with security and respect for their human rights ,  but she recognises that changing racist attitudes towards them in myanmar could take generations . in the meantime ,  she is trying to “build bridges” .   as a facilitator ,  she has to talk to everyone including the army ,  she says .  she doesn’t believe in “megaphone diplomacy” or in closing doors .   she has already met with army officials and armed groups ,  and with state councillor aung san suu kyi ,  the nobel peace prize winner whom many now see as a fallen idol for not having spoken out on the rohingya crisis .  but schraner burgener believes suu kyi still has a role to play .  “she was 15 years under house arrest .  i don’t believe that such a person would not continue to fight for democracy , ” she says .  “but her situation is really difficult ,  she is squeezed between the army and also the expectations of the international community .  my personal attitude is we have to support her .  it’s clear many were disappointed that she was not loud enough to say what happened is unacceptable .  but we must also see that she has to work with the army ,  because they also have a veto right for each amendment of the constitution . ”                          un special envoy to myanmar  "this country was 60 years isolated and under the army .  .  . "      schraner burgener has been to rakhine and to the rohingya refugee camps in bangladesh .  she describes what happened in rakhine as “really ,  really terrible” ,  saying what is needed is “accountability and inclusive dialogue” .  asked what form accountability should take ,  she says that “fact finding is the first step and then the courts have to decide .  what is important is that there is credible and transparent fact finding” . "the government of myanmar were against the mandate ,   but when they met me the first time ,  the first thing they said was we accepted you because you are swiss" myanmar has barred the un’s special rapporteur on myanmar ,  yangee lee of south korea ,  from visiting the country .  but schraner burgener says all her travel requests within the country have so far been met .  as a facilitator ,  does it help her to be swiss ?  here’s her answer:                           christine schraner burgener  "we accepted you because you are swiss"      schraner burgener believes that to be a successful facilitator ,  you also need to know the “mentality and culture” .  for example ,  she says ,  people in asia feel that being direct is a sign of arrogance . “honestly ,  behind closed doors i’m very critical of the myanmar government ,  but i will never do megaphone diplomacy -- in my position that will not bring results .  on the contrary ,  they will just close the doors . ”in order to continue to make progress ,  she says ,  she needs to convince the international community of her strategy of neutrality . but she says she sometimes feels like a “punching bag” ,  including with member states in the un .  she has been travelling constantly ,  and only sees her family in bern about four days per month .  she has also been seeing and hearing some terrible things .  this is how she copes:                           christine schraner burgener   "i find energy from the interior"      ultimately ,  schraner burgener says she wants to see results .  “even though i have a lot of patience ,  i also need to see actions , ” she tells us .  “if i don’t see enough actions in a certain period of time ,  then i will [reconsider] my mandate ,  that’s clear .  sometimes people think that i am too optimistic or too patient ,  but i also have my principles . ”          sign up for our free newsletters and get the top stories delivered to your inbox .    #mc_embed_signup div . response { margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em  . 5em  . 5em 0; font-weight: bold; float: left; top: -1 . 5em; z-index: 1; width: 80%;} label { display: inline; }    / * add your own mailchimp form style overrides in your site stylesheet or in this style block .  we recommend moving this block and the preceding css link to the head of your html file .  * /       email address     top stories  ( weekly )  latest news  ( daily )  business  ( weekly )  politics  ( weekly )  society  ( weekly )  fintech  ( biweekly )  multinationals  ( biweekly )  click here to see more newsletters              ( function ( $ )  {window . fnames = new array (  ) ; window . ftypes = new array (  ) ;fnames[0]= ' email ' ;ftypes[0]= ' email ' ;fnames[1]= ' fname ' ;ftypes[1]= ' text ' ;fnames[2]= ' lname ' ;ftypes[2]= ' text ' ;} ( jquery )  ) ;var $mcj = jquery . noconflict ( true ) ;      
__label__9     fire at asylum seeker housing calls safety into question  - swi swissinfo . ch             a worker cleans out a fire-damaged apartment where six people died earlier this week ( © keystone  /  alexandra wey )        a tragic fire that killed several asylum seekers ,  including children ,  has highlighted switzerland’s lack of a smoke alarm requirement as well as other safety challenges in asylum seeker accommodations . the fire happened overnight on november 26 in an apartment complex in canton solothurn ,  a german-speaking region north of the swiss capital bern .  the four adults and three children who died were later identified as asylum seekers from ethiopia and eritrea . they were among the asylum seekers in the canton who are sheltered in houses or apartments while waiting for the next step in the asylum process .  according to claudia hänzi of the canton solothurn migration authorities ,  the canton sometimes seeks such special accommodations for families ,  for example ,  so they can live together in their own space . “these were completely normal rental apartments , ” hänzi says of the units affected by the fire .  “it was a coincidence that we happened to be renting them for asylum seekers when the accident took place . ”  the solothurn cantonal police told the media that they believe the fire was caused by “negligent handling of smoking implements” and that one person had been held and questioned .  non-asylum seekers also lived in the building . fire alarms optionalin solothurn fire alarms and smoke detectors are not required ,  since they are deemed optional for private residences under swiss fire safety law . in 2015 ,  a study by the association of cantonal fire insurers and with the swiss federal institute of technology eth zurich concluded that requiring smoke detectors makes no economic sense .  this is because the costs associated with requiring detectors nationwide are too high compared to the number of people that could be saved by having them ,  according to the study . but the swiss firefighters’ association is now advocating for a smoke detector requirement ,  according to the solothurner zeitung newspaper .  canton solothurn parliamentarian bea heim told the newspaper that “a smoke alarm would probably have prevented” the casualties in the november 26 fire . issues with smokingsuch alarms are required in larger asylum centres hosting dozens or hundreds of asylum seekers .  but john* ,  an asylum seeker from ethiopia who reached out to swissinfo . ch after the solothurn fire ,  says that while living in such a centre ,  he observed asylum seekers who wanted to smoke in their rooms covering the smoke detectors with plastic to disable them .  when he told the authorities ,  they sent someone by to check – but each time someone came ,  the plastic had been removed . john lives in canton aargau ,  which borders solothurn .  he’s moved from the asylum centre to an apartment building with 15 to 20 other asylum seekers ,  and shares a room with two others .  he says most of the people he lives with smoke constantly and everywhere ,  often disposing of still-lit cigarette butts in trash cans .  and his apartment has no fire alarms or smoke detectors . pia maria brugger of canton aargau’s asylum and social services department says that smoking is not allowed indoors at any asylum seeker housing ,  and that the responsible authorities are always on the lookout for whether anyone has been smoking outside designated areas .  people caught breaking the smoking rules are reprimanded and may have their daily allowance reduced if the problem recurs ,  she notes . brugger also says that all asylum seekers are made aware of the rules when they arrive ,  both through verbal instruction and through printed house rules made available in a variety of languages .  as for manipulation of smoke detectors ,  brugger notes that this is usually automatically detected by the alarm system and reported to a monitoring station .  “this allows us to react quickly , ” she says . but john says that all too often ,  these rules are simply disregarded . “they’ve been told not to smoke in the house ,  but they don’t care , ” he says of his roommates ,  adding that he’s struggled to remind his fellow asylum seekers of what’s allowed because of language barriers and because he sometimes fears retaliation .  plus ,  so many people living in close quarters increases the risk of an accident ,  he says . ‘just a tragedy’was overcrowding a factor in the solothurn fire ?  hänzi says no . in the apartment complex affected ,  canton solothurn was housing 11 asylum seekers across four units .  nine other people lived in the building .  some media had reported in the fire’s aftermath that 20 people were living in a space meant for nine ,  but hänzi says that’s incorrect . “the nine [non-asylum seekers] were registered with the city as usual ,  but the 11 asylum seekers were not because it’s not possible to register them under the same system , ” she explains ,  adding that authorities were fully aware they were living there . “this could have happened anywhere; it’s just a tragedy , ” she says .  a memorial service for the victims will be held at the cathedral in solothurn on december 8 .     *name has been changed due to ongoing asylum process            sign up for our free newsletters and get the top stories delivered to your inbox .    #mc_embed_signup div . response { margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em  . 5em  . 5em 0; font-weight: bold; float: left; top: -1 . 5em; z-index: 1; width: 80%;} label { display: inline; }    / * add your own mailchimp form style overrides in your site stylesheet or in this style block .  we recommend moving this block and the preceding css link to the head of your html file .  * /       email address     top stories  ( weekly )  latest news  ( daily )  business  ( weekly )  politics  ( weekly )  society  ( weekly )  fintech  ( biweekly )  multinationals  ( biweekly )  click here to see more newsletters              ( function ( $ )  {window . fnames = new array (  ) ; window . ftypes = new array (  ) ;fnames[0]= ' email ' ;ftypes[0]= ' email ' ;fnames[1]= ' fname ' ;ftypes[1]= ' text ' ;fnames[2]= ' lname ' ;ftypes[2]= ' text ' ;} ( jquery )  ) ;var $mcj = jquery . noconflict ( true ) ;      
__label__10     how much tech should be in swiss classrooms ?  - swi swissinfo . ch             tablets and not text books - how education is changing  ( © keystone  /  gaetan bally )        where pupils once sat at their desks with the teacher at the blackboard ,  they might now be putting together a video essay or learning to code a robot .  education is undergoing a sea change ,  but not everyone in switzerland feels ready for it . digitalisation – the move from analogue to digital technology – was a big buzzword at the recent worlddidac and swissdidac fairs on educational trends held in bern .  there were many digital learning technologies on display ,  including this finnish language-learning robot .                    chatterbox  elias: the robot who ' ll try your favourite food      in switzerland ,  digital learning technologies have been used in classrooms for some time ,  but it has only recently become a big public issue ,  said beat a .  schwendimann of german-speaking switzerland’s federation of swiss teachers  ( lch )  . over the last year ,  the swiss government has released its digitalisation strategy and the cantons – which are in charge of education in switzerland – have published their blueprint for schools . “things are moving forward in switzerland , ” schwendimann says regarding educational technology . ‘learning first ,  technology second’joseph south is the chief learning officer at the united states-based international society for technology and education  ( iste )  ,  which held the “transforming education” conference at worlddidac .  the former director of the office of educational technology at the us department of education says this is the moment when educators need to be thinking through the right strategy for digitalisation ,  since it’s “impacting every part of the education system” . south says the priority should be on “learning first and technology second” . “when you do school tours ,  ipads are everywhere ,  but that doesn’t actually change learning , ” he explains .  “you can do things just as right or just as wrong as you were before ,  with or without an ipad . ”technology needs to be a transformational experience for learning ,  emphasises south ,  whose organisation has developed standards for using tech in the classroom . effects on pupilsbut there are still some concerns over the effects of tech on pupils ,  even in the us where digital learning technology has been in use for some time .  south points out that using a device to communicate or problem solve ,  for example ,  is different from just passively watching and listening . “part of the reason there is a slow uptake in some places is that we ' re don ' t trust tech ,  we ' re not sure that it’s going to be better for us , ” he says .  “we’re right to be wary ,  as it can be used in a way that isn’t helpful .  but the upside ,  the possibilities for transformation ,  are so great that we really do need to embrace it . ”students also need to learn how to be good digital citizens ,  he adds .  this means learning when to use technology ,  how to use it civilly ,  and how to use it to bring about change “if this is done ,  a lot of our concerns about technology will go away , ” south argues . teachers’ concernsin switzerland ,  the teachers’ federation  ( lch )  ,  along with its french-speaking counterpart ser ,  recently set down a similar viewpoint to south’s in a position paper on educational technology . “we call it ‘pedagogy before technology’ , ” says schwendimann ,  adding that key is to ensure that “tech really adds value to education .  it’s not just the number of digital devices in the classroom that counts ,  but how they are being used” . for this ,  schwendimann and his colleagues argue ,  teachers need proper training and innovative text books . but he admits that some teachers ,  curious as they are about learning and developing professionally ,  are anxious about the introduction of new technologies .  teachers are rightfully cautious about claims by edtech companies ,  he says .  they need reliable curriculum activities ,  for which they need to be trained . schwendimann notes that all too often ,  politicians allocate one-time budgets for hardware but then expect teachers to muddle through using it on their own . and the goal is not to have technology everywhere and all the time ,  he emphasises .  “teachers need to use their professional judgement to decide when to use digital technologies in the classroom ,  and when not to use digital technologies . ”nevertheless ,  a mandatory media and informatics module has been introduced at the primary-school level under the new unified lehrplan 21 curriculum being phased into german-speaking switzerland .  similarly ,  the curriculum in the french-speaking part includes media and informatics  ( mitic )  as a cross-subject topic .   +read here why it is also mandatory at upper secondary schoolsthese courses are designed to help prepare students for the digital world ,  schwendimann says . computational thinking iste’s joseph south was impressed by one area of educational technology in which switzerland seems to be ahead of the curve: its emphasis on computational thinking ,  or the breaking down of a problem so that a machine can execute it . for example ,  a computational thinking initiative  ( cti )  for education ,  supported by the teachers’ federation  ( lch )  ,  was launched during the nationwide digital day on october 25 .  it uses the robot “thymio” to teach these skills to primary school pupils .  the technology was developed by the swiss federal institute of technology in lausanne  ( epfl )  .                      science saturday  new centre adds computational thinking to school curricula      to schwendimann ,  schools are facing two challenges: the use of technology as teaching tools ,  and how to teach about technology as content  ( such as fake news or social media )  .  overall ,  he concludes ,  switzerland is doing well at dealing with technology in education ,  but there is more to be done to compete with countries in scandinavia or

__label__10     swiss implant makers come under the microscope - swi swissinfo . ch             the implant files recorded 70 , 000 recalls ,  safety alerts and field safety notices for implanted devices .  ( keystone )        the implant files revelations of faulty implants and weak safety standards are raising alarm bells for switzerland’s rapidly growing medical device industry .  manufacturers and industry bodies say that safety standards have improved in the last decade ,  but do they go far enough ? the market for implanted medical devices is booming globally .  tens of thousands of people are walking around with implants ,  from hip replacements to pacemakers and defibrillators . according to the implant files released on monday ,  many of these people face serious health risks ,  in some cases fatal ,  from what are intended to be life-saving implants .  the research was conducted by 250 journalists across more than 30 countries ,  including swiss journalists from tamedia ,  that are part of the international consortium of investigative journalists  ( icij )  . the investigation suggests that products are often rushed onto the market with sub-standard testing or approval procedures ,  and for many ,  recalls are too late – the damage is irreparable .  in switzerland ,  there were approximately 1 , 400 complications due to medical implants last year according to report on swiss public radio ,  srf .  this includes ,  for example ,  spinal implants that disintegrate in the body causing long-term damage . post-scandal reformsaccording to peter studer ,  head of regulatory affairs at swiss medtech ,  which represents the interests of the swiss medtech industry including implant makers ,  the journalist consortium report refers largely to cases that occurred before major changes in the medical device industry from 2012 . in a written statement to swissinfo . ch ,  he said that the implant files focus on cases around the time or prior to the infamous pip scandal ,  when french company poly implant prothèse was found to be illegally manufacturing and selling breast implants made from cheaper industrial-grade silicone since 2001 . + more on how the pip scandal affected switzerlandin reaction to the pip scandal ,  there was a major effort to reduce the number and improve the quality of notified bodies ,  which are organisations legally designated to assess the conformity of certain products with laws before they go on the market . there have also been efforts to improve the speed and accuracy of reporting of issues through the siris swiss implant registry launched in 2012 and the reporting system of swissmedic ,  the swiss agency for therapeutic products . in an email to swissinfo . ch ,  swissmedic said that in the case of serious events ,  authorities take the necessary measures - up to and including a recall or market withdrawal .  every recall and other “field safety corrective actions”  ( fsca )  reported to swissmedic is published on a designated website . do the reforms go far enough ? but do these reforms go far enough in protecting patients ?  swiss-based sonova ,  one of the largest manufacturers of hearing care solutions ,  has confidence in its safety procedures .  it is the parent company of advanced bionics that had a cochlear implant device recall prior to 2012 listed in the icij database of 70 , 000 recalls ,  safety alerts and field safety notices . in a statement to swissinfo . ch ,  sonova explained that advanced bionics’ quality management system has been certified by globally recognised standards and its products are submitted for review and approval by the relevant regulatory agency before distribution .  any adverse events with products like its implantable cochlear stimulator system are reported to applicable regulatory agencies and made available to customers in its product reliability report . medical device industrymedical devices  ( medtech is often used synonymously )  includes instruments used for medical purposes that are not drugs and can range from implants and heart pacemakers to syringes ,  wheelchairs ,  and mris .  the swiss medtech industry generates annual sales of chf15 . 8 billion  ( $15 . 9 billion )  and exports of chf11 . 3 billion according to swiss medtech .  there are more than 1 , 400 medical device companies employing more than 58 , 500 people in switzerland and the industry contributes 2 . 3% to switzerland’s gdp . swiss medtech reports that nearly 40 , 000 knee and hip prosthetic joints and 70 , 000 artificial lenses are implanted each year ,  while some 4 , 500 patients receive a pacemaker and an implantable defibrillator . but the journalistic consortium’s report argues that “implants don’t require large-scale human trials for devices like they do for prescription drugs .  as a result ,  authorities have allowed faulty devices to come onto the market” . swiss medtech’s studer argues that it is misplaced to compare medical devices to pharmaceuticals .  he says that there are 10 , 000 medicinal products compared with 500 , 000 different medical devices that have huge variations .  the range of applications for medical devices means that “authorisation procedures can’t be adapted one to one to medical devices compliance procedures” . however ,  in many of the cases reported by the journalists ,  the problems didn’t show up until long after a device was implanted and many devices showed no signs of problems when tested on animals ,  indicating that more robust testing could have prevented significant pain and suffering . other concerns in the testing and approval system have also been raised by swiss parliamentarians in recent days including the fact that the onus is often on doctors and hospitals to report problems ,  which doesn’t always happen ,  said bernhard bichsel ,  head of medical devices at swissmedic in another report on swiss public broadcaster ,  rts . in the fast lanemedtech  ( or medical devices )  is one of the fastest growing industries in switzerland with more than 4 , 000 new employees in the industry in the last two years .  there are more than 1 , 400 medtech companies ,  which includes implant manufacturers ,  employing more than 58 , 500 people in switzerland . aside from some of the big players like johnson & johnson medical ,  roche diagnostics and sonova ,  the large majority are start-ups .  some 93% of companies employ fewer than 250 employees and four out of five companies have fewer than 50 employees ,  according to the 2018 sector study by swiss medtechthis raises the question that has been a thorn in the side of the pharmaceutical industry for decades .  how do you balance the need for robust safety regulations with the desire to get potentially life-saving products on the market as quickly as possible ? for small companies with limited bandwidth ,  this question is even more pressing .  the sector study found that many medtech companies were struggling with the increasing requirements for quality and documentation due to new european union regulations  ( see box below )  . medical device regulations in switzerlandthe swiss medical devices ordinance has been in force since 2002 and was updated in 2010 to harmonise swiss law with the eu’s revised medical devices directives .  switzerland and the eu have established a mutual recognition agreement which means that the country is integrated into the european market surveillance and that equivalent relevant legal requirements to the eu exist in switzerland . in spring 2017 two new regulations were adopted by the european commission on medical devices  ( mdr )  and in-vitro diagnostics  ( ivdr )  with the aim of significantly improving patient safety by improving risk assessment ,  market surveillance and increased transparency .  it will become mandatory in eu member states starting from may 2020 and may 2022 ,  respectively . discussions are currently underway in the swiss government regarding a revised medical devices law to align with the latest eu regulations .    swissinfo . ch         sign up for our free newsletters and get the top stories delivered to your inbox .    #mc_embed_signup div . response { margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em  . 5em  . 5em 0; font-weight: bold; float: left; top: -1 . 5em; z-index: 1; width: 80%;} label { display: inline; }    / * add your own mailchimp form style overrides in your site stylesheet or in this style block .  we recommend moving this block and the preceding css link to the head of your html file .  * /       email address     top stories  ( weekly )  latest news  ( daily )  business  ( weekly )  politics  ( weekly )  society  ( weekly )  fintech  ( biweekly )  multinationals  ( biweekly )  click here to see more newsletters              ( function ( $ )  {window . fnames = new array (  ) ; window . ftypes = new array (  ) ;fnames[0]= ' email ' ;ftypes[0]= ' email ' ;fnames[1]= ' fname ' ;ftypes[1]= ' text ' ;fnames[2]= ' lname ' ;ftypes[2]= ' text ' ;} ( jquery )  ) ;var $mcj = jquery . noconflict ( true ) ;

__label__12     more working hours for women ?  easier said than done - swi swissinfo . ch             take it to the streets: demonstrators call for equal pay and recognition of unpaid work managing a household .  ( keystone )        encouraging women to increase their working hours could be one answer to tackling looming labour shortages in switzerland .  currently ,  six out of ten women in the country work part-time – one of the highest rates in europe . over the next decade ,  nearly a million people will retire in switzerland ,  while just 500 , 000 will enter the workforce ,  according to estimates by the swiss employers '  union . the union ' s president ,  valentin vogt ,  is lobbying for women in the workforce to increase their hours by more than 60% .  "the issue is not to create new part-time jobs ,  but to ensure that working women increase their percentage , " he said in a recent interview with several german-language newspapers . while switzerland is a country where the proportion of women in employment  ( more than 80% )  is among the highest in europe ,  it is also at the top of the ranking in terms of women employed part-time ,  just behind the netherlands . + how work responsibilities have shifted for women and men over the yearsit ' s common for women to work from a day and a half to three days a week ,  with mothers of school-age children often at the lower end .  the situation is partly made possible thanks to high salaries ,  but it ' s also a direct response to the challenge of reconciling work with family commitments; in many parts of the country ,  schoolchildren are expected to go home for lunch . "despite changes in recent years ,  childcare facilities are often still too scarce and too expensive .  for many mothers ,  it doesn ' t always add up financially to work more hours , " says irenka krone-germann ,  director of the part-time optimisation association and co-founder of we jobshare . new approaches neededat the same time ,  the gap between men and women working part-time is one of the widest in the world .  "switzerland is an extremely conservative country in terms of sharing responsibilities , " says krone-germann . although more and more men  ( 17 . 5% )  opt for part-time work ,  childcare is often not the main reason .  "they do so primarily for training or to have time for their hobbies .  they reduce their workload by 20% .  family reasons are secondary ,  while these are the main reasons for a large majority of women , " she says . + where does switzerland stand generally on gender equality ? a study by the federal statistical office published this summer showed that the number of men working part-time actually fell with the arrival of a child . gender inequalities are such that ,  in the economist ' s view ,  the swiss labour market is one of the most discriminatory in europe .  the "glass-ceiling index" published at the beginning of the year by the magazine put switzerland in 26th place out of 29 countries in the ranking of gender equality in the labour market . of the ten criteria used in the index ,  switzerland rated very poorly with regard to the cost of childcare and the length of maternity and paternity leave .  the low proportion of women on corporate boards and the gender gap in access to higher education also knocked switzerland down the ranking . the findings support krone-germann ' s argument for new and innovative forms of work within companies ,  such as job-sharing .  it ' s not enough just to tell women to work more ,  she insists . "companies should offer their employees ,  both women and men ,  the opportunity to pursue a career while working part-time .  job-sharing is an excellent way to keep talent on the job market , " she concludes .        wef report 2017  workplace gender gap fuels switzerland’s plunge in global index              sign up for our free newsletters and get the top stories delivered to your inbox .    #mc_embed_signup div . response { margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em  . 5em  . 5em 0; font-weight: bold; float: left; top: -1 . 5em; z-index: 1; width: 80%;} label { display: inline; }    / * add your own mailchimp form style overrides in your site stylesheet or in this style block .  we recommend moving this block and the preceding css link to the head of your html file .  * /       email address     top stories  ( weekly )  latest news  ( daily )  business  ( weekly )  politics  ( weekly )  society  ( weekly )  fintech  ( biweekly )  multinationals  ( biweekly )  click here to see more newsletters              ( function ( $ )  {window . fnames = new array (  ) ; window . ftypes = new array (  ) ;fnames[0]= ' email ' ;ftypes[0]= ' email ' ;fnames[1]= ' fname ' ;ftypes[1]= ' text ' ;fnames[2]= ' lname ' ;ftypes[2]= ' text ' ;} ( jquery )  ) ;var $mcj = jquery . noconflict ( true ) ;

"do we really only want to offer good and cheap accommodation to our young girls ? " asked the president of the marta association at the opening ceremony of the newly built women ' s pension in 1928 .  "no ,  we want more .  we want to give them a home ,  even if it can only be a temporary one .  it should be a place where they feel safe . " committed to womenthe freshly renovated and newly christened "josephine ' s guesthouse for women"  is still a haven for women who visit switzerland’s largest city as students ,  as tourists or for business and for women who need a place to find peace and a new direction after a crisis .  the spirit of the former establishment still lives on in this modern version .  josephine ' s is still reserved for female guests who can book rooms for a night or a few months .  apart from a male technician ,  only women work there .  otherwise ,  men are only allowed as far as the reception desk .  named after the british women ' s rights campaigner and social reformer josephine butler  ,  the guest house remains dedicated to the social ideals of its namesake: up to 10 of the 38 rooms are reserved for women in or emerging from crisis situations .         a room at josephine ' s ( franz rindlisbacher )        verena kern nyberg manages the not-for-profit frauenhotel company ,  in charge of josephine’s as well as the ladys first and marta hotels in zurich .  she is convinced that josephine ' s "captures the spirit of the times” through its popular long-term rentals ,  as well as its fostering of female community and its commitment to women in need .  josephine ' s always reserves a few rooms in the cheapest price category for these women ,  as "emergency situations cannot be planned” ,  says kern nyberg .  on average ,  8 to 10 women occupy these rooms ,  often with their young children . ‘uncomplicated ,  fast and no deposit’particularly in zurich ,  where finding affordable rental accommodation is a challenge ,  josephine ' s fills a gap . "here they get temporary accommodation ,  fast ,  without complications and without having to pay a deposit or compete against 50 other tenants for an apartment , " explains kern nyberg .  guest relations manager doris albisser is convinced that “there could be more such guest houses and they would all be filled” .  josephine ' s works ,  she says ,  "because people function independently here" .  the kitchen and laundry room are available to all guests .  whether a woman is in zurich for a week and would rather cook than eat alone in a restaurant ,  or she has been referred by the city’s social services department ,  such facilities allow guests to meet their own needs .   ( zurich’s social services cover lodging costs for residents who need emergency accommodation )  .         doris albisser ( christina stucky ,  bern )        diverse life stories"many don ' t talk about the situation that brought them here .  they share fragments .  we rarely know their whole life story , " says albisser . these life stories are as varied as the women themselves .  one woman first fled domestic violence to zurich ' s shelter for battered women  and is now using her time at josephine ' s to plan her next steps .  a pregnant foreign student was kicked out of a shared flat .  another woman has to reorient her life after a prison sentence ,  and a rejected asylum seeker and her infant are waiting to be deported .  some of the hotel guests ask questions after reading about the guesthouse ' s social commitment on its website and or talk to one of the women at the daily breakfast buffet .  the paying guests’ reactions are usually positive ,  says albisser .  she has developed a feeling for whether a woman "fits into the house and will abide by the rules" .   serious violations of the house rules can lead to dismissal .  for example ,  a woman who repeatedly smuggled a man into her room and got into a fight with him there was dismissed without notice . josephine ' s communitythe key to josephine ' s '  success is maintaining a balance between an economically viable hotel and a "place for women who have had a streak of bad luck" ,  says kern nyberg .  she emphasises that the guest house wants to maintain a diverse community of women who have an open ear for each other’s concerns .  ultimately ,  says the manager of josephine’s ,  the guest house is defined more by the community found within its walls than by its offer of refuge for women in need .  she is delighted with the positive feedback from those who stay in the hotel portion of the facility .  "they keep telling us what cool women they meet at josephine ' s . "        the communal kitchen and eating area are open to all guests at josephine ' s .

__label__2     swiss make slow progress returning nazi-looted art - swi swissinfo . ch             the verso ,  or back of each painting ,  is distinct: owners add their labels ,  exhibitions are noted ,  and customs stamps bear witness to the often long journeys experienced by the works - and in the case of looted or stolen artworks ,  they also may provide valuable hints to their origin .   ( musée des beaux-arts ,  la chaux-de-fonds ,  2018 )        progress in switzerland has been patchy since the country endorsed the washington principles - a set of guidelines to encourage museums to find and identify nazi-looted art .  switzerland was one of 44 governments and organisations to agree to the principles 20 years ago .  the stated goal was to uncover nazi-looted art in their collections and seek “just and fair solutions” with the heirs of the original jewish owners . alain monteagle fought for more than a decade to recover his family’s painting by the british artist john constable from the musée des beaux arts in la chaux-de-fonds ,  a small city in switzerland’s jura mountains near the french border .  “dedham from langham” had been looted from the nice home of his jewish great-great-aunt ,  anna jaffé ,  after her death in 1942 – along with everything else she owned .  the la chaux-de-fonds museum received it as part of a bequest .  when monteagle first approached city officials ,  they refused to relinquish it ,  even while acknowledging it was stolen .  ronald lauder ,  the president of the world jewish congress ,  in 2016 described this response as showing “a troubling lack of shame” .        john constable ' s "dedham from langham"  ( c .  1812 )  ( photo: pierre bohrer ,  le locle ,  2017 ©: musée des beaux-arts ,  la chaux-de-fonds ,  2018 )        monteagle says he collected signatures on the city marketplace ,  threatened a court case ,  and finally got the painting back in march this year .  “they didn’t want to hear anything from us , ” says monteagle ,  who lives in france and has recovered family artworks from as far afield as texas .  “their lawyer told them not to have direct contact with us .  it was all so unpleasant . ” the non-binding washington principles ,  which switzerland endorsed in 1998 ,  were designed to prevent exactly this kind of scenario .  governments agreed to encourage museums to conduct provenance research on their collections ,  identify art seized by the nazis ,  and seek “just and fair solutions” with the original jewish collectors and their heirs on stolen works .  swiss officials are among the attendees at a conference in berlin from november 26-28  ( live stream )  to mark the 20th anniversary and examine international achievements so far and what remains to be done .  in switzerland ,  attitudes are changing ,  says nina zimmer ,  the director of the kunstmuseum  ( fine arts museum )  in bern .  the subject of nazi-looted art has repeatedly grabbed headlines; in recent times with cornelius gurlitt’s bequest to the fine arts museum – a controversial gift that bern hesitated to accept .        gurlitt’s father worked as a dealer for the nazis and the hoard of art in cornelius’s munich and salzburg homes included works that were stolen or purchased at low prices from jews forced to leave nazi germany .  paintings by henri matisse and max liebermann  ( "two riders on the beach" ,  1901 ,  pictured above )  are among the works that have so far been restituted from the gurlitt hoard .  ( de . wikipedia . org )        the focus on bern has helped raise awareness ,  zimmer says .  “the mood has completely shifted , ” she says .  “many of our colleagues here are now involved in this subject . ” among the problems in the past ,  she says ,  have been a shortage of funding and a lack of expertise .  another stumbling block has been the art market ,  with dealers resistant to opening up their archives for research ,  says thomas buomberger ,  a historian and the author of a book about nazi art looting and switzerland .  swiss institutions have now addressed the first two of these issues to at least some extent: the kunstmuseum is working with bern university to train young provenance researchers ,  and the swiss government in 2016 made funding for provenance research available to museums for the first time .        “even though these initiatives are an encouraging start ,  we need permanent funding , ” zimmer  ( pictured above )  says .  “at the moment ,  it is all funded by special grants and one-time funding initiatives . ” ( keystone / lukas lehmann )        the swiss federal office for culture has allocated chf2 million  ( $2 . 01 million )  for provenance research in museums from 2016 to 2020 .  museums must apply on a project basis and must match the sum they receive from independent sources .  the maximum amount awarded per project is 100 , 000 swiss francs .  it announced the latest batch of funding for 14 provenance research projects on nov .  19 – among the museums to receive maximum grants are the kunstmuseum in bern ,  the kunstmuseum basel and the fondation beyeler .  the first 12 projects from 2016-2018 have been largely completed and the results published ,  according to the office .  benno widmer ,  head of the museums and collections department ,  says demand for the funding has been high ,  suggesting museums are increasingly taking responsibility .  marc-andré renold ,  a professor of art law at the university of geneva and the lawyer who represented monteagle against la chaux-de-fonds in the constable case ,  points to another community in french-speaking switzerland as an example of how attitudes have shifted in the past ten years .        the canton of jura received a painting by gustave courbet ,  a jura landscape valued at about chf300 , 000 ,  as a bequest in 2015 .  it wasn’t listed in the official catalogue of the artist’s work ,  and when cantonal authorities discovered that the donor’s father may have purchased the painting in düsseldorf in 1939 ,  alarm bells sounded .  ( république de canton du jura / pierre montavon )        the cantonal government commissioned an expert report to examine provenance and authenticity .  when no evidence was found that the painting was looted ,  officials handed the landscape to the musée jurassien d’art et d’histoire at delémont ,  on the understanding that if it was later found to be stolen ,  it would be restituted .  they published their report online .  “they did everything right , ” renold says .  yet he concedes that in general ,  switzerland could have done more to implement the washington principles .  “we are not extremely proactive , ” he says .  for instance the last of the principles ,  number 11 ,  calls for “national processes to implement these principles ,  particularly as they relate to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms for resolving ownership issues . ” france ,  germany ,  austria ,  the netherlands and the united kingdom all set up government-appointed panels to issue recommendations on disputed artworks .  swedish museums this year asked the government to establish a similar commission .  yet switzerland has never done so .  widmer at the federal office says the question was raised in parliament ,  but the government responded that there were not enough cases to make such a panel worthwhile .  nonetheless ,  renold says ,  such a panel would be helpful in cases such as monteagle’s constable .  “there is a lack of political will and they don’t want to put money in it , ” renold says .  “when we were stuck in the constable case ,  we turned to bern and asked for help .  they said ‘sure ,  we can offer you a conference room . ’ if you have a case ,  you are on your own . ”and like monteagle ,  some claimants have been kept waiting years .  ten years ago ,  the basel kunstmuseum rejected a claim by the heirs of curt glaser for more than 100 artworks in its collection ,  including pieces by henri matisse ,  marc chagall and edvard munch .  the city’s art commission agreed last year to review the decision; it has yet to announce the results of that review .  part of the reason switzerland has been slow to apply the principles may be that it wasn’t a combatant in the second world war ,  says olaf ossmann ,  a switzerland-based lawyer who handles looted art cases .  “in the swiss view ,  switzerland did not even take part in the war ,  so why should they solve the germans’ problems ? ” he asks .  ossmann says some dealers and collectors were unhappy that the bern kunstmuseum accepted gurlitt’s controversial bequest .  provenance research on the gurlitt collection was first carried out in germany ,  and “they were concerned that german standards of provenance research and restitution would now be applied to switzerland , ”   he says .  one distinction between the german and swiss approach to nazi-looted art has been partly linguistic: in switzerland ,  the term “fluchtgut” or “flight assets” has long been used to describe art sold by jews to fund their escape from nazi germany or to start a new life elsewhere after losing the rest of their possessions ,  their homes and their livelihoods .  in germany ,  the term “art lost to persecution” covers these and other forced sales or sales under duress .  swiss museums have traditionally rejected claims for “fluchtgut” .  but in april ,  the culture office issued a glossary reminding museums and collectors that “fluchtgut” is not an internationally recognised concept and is “open to different interpretations” .  every case must be judged individually on its own merits ,  and claims for “fluchtgut” may also be justified ,  the office said .  the washington principles were never designed to cover private collectors ,  and the means at claimants’ disposal to recover nazi-looted art in private collections remains limited .  if they go to court ,  claims usually fail because of statutes of limitation .  but increasingly ,  private collectors internationally are growing aware of the difficulties of selling or exhibiting works with unclear provenance – and as a wealthy country ,  switzerland has a lot of collectors .  ossmann said he has been approached by swiss individuals seeking advice .  “private owners are starting to check their collections ,  particularly after an inheritance , ” he says .  “it’s usually just for their own information ,  but it’s a good first step . ” and if they do choose to keep illicitly acquired goods ,  collectors have swiss freeports at their disposal to hide them .  ossmann describes them as “a huge black hole in a world where everything is moving towards greater transparency” . degas casechris marinello ,  a london-based lawyer for the heirs of paul rosenberg ,  is seeking a degas pastel ,  “portrait of mlle .  gabrielle diot , ” that was looted by the nazis from the home of the legendary parisian art dealer after he had fled occupied france with his family .  the pastel was purchased by a swiss family in 1942 ,  then changed hands again in 1974 .  marinello says its last known location is a storage centre in basel ,  where it was spotted in 2003 .   he has been working with a swiss lawyer to try to find and freeze the picture ,  but hasn’t so far been able to trace the current holder or the exact location .  the rosenbergs are still seeking 60 artworks in total .  “i think half of them could be in switzerland , ” marinello says .  “it was one of the first places paul rosenberg went to recover his artworks after the war .  and he faced people saying to him: ‘we have your artwork; how much will you pay to get it back ?

__label__7     medicines: is switzerland too rich to save money ?  - swi swissinfo . ch             an employee of biocon ltd works inside the company ' s research and development centre in bengaluru ,  india .  the country ,  which has dominated the generic drugs industry for decades ,  is falling behind in the race to make copies of complex biotech drugs ( abhishek n .  chinnappa  / reuters )        switzerland could save millions of francs by prescribing low-priced biotech drug copies ,  known as biosimilars ,  instead of expensive biologicals - expensive drugs produced in living cells .  however ,  there are disincentives which are typical of the ailing swiss system .  emily whitehead was suffering from leukaemia .  the six-year old american girl had undergone numerous chemotherapy treatments ,  but nothing worked .  the doctors told her parents it was time to find a place in a hospice ,  but then ,  a miracle happened .  the doctors treated the girl with experimental genetically-modified human immunodeficiency viruses .  emily is now 13 and completely healthy .  this is just one of many stories about seriously ill patients undergoing treatment with new drugs called biologicals ,  which are produced through a biological process rather than chemical synthesis  ( see infobox )  .  such drugs ,  often produced involving biotechnology methods ,  are currently shaking up the drug industry ,  especially in the fields of cancer ,  arthritis ,  diabetes ,  heart diseases and growth disorders . new drugsbiologicals are biotechnologically produced drugs .  biosimilars are copies of biologicals ,  which means they are generics .  unlike generics of chemically produced drugs ,  biosimilars are similar to the original product ,  but not identical .  hence ,  the approval process for biosimilars is much more cumbersome than for generics .  even though biosimilars are still costly due to their complex production and need for approval ,  swissmedic’s regulations stipulate that they have to be sold at least 25% cheaper than the original biological product . however ,  such happy endings come with a cost .  developing and producing biologicals is very expensive .  even though they are rarely used for treatments in switzerland ,  biologicals make up 20% of drug costs ,  which are soaring .  this is part of the reason why health insurance premiums are rising every year and are becoming difficult to afford for many swiss .  during a recent press conference ,  a representative from the helsana health insurance company warned that medical progress had its price and if we did not start to save money “we would soon be unable to afford innovation” .  saving with biosimilarsone way to save money is the use of so-called biosimilars ,  which are basically generic products of biologicals .  since many patents of biologicals are expiring ,  helsana sees a great saving potential in biosimilars .  according to the insurer’s calculations ,  around chf35 million  ( $35 million )  could have been saved in 2016 if available biosimilars had been used instead of the originals .  a forecast for 2020 even predicts potential savings of chf300 million .  alexander salzmann of sandoz pharmaceuticals ag told swissinfo . ch: “we have done our maths ,  and we guess that we could save around chf100 million or more per year . ” the catch is that ,  unlike other european countries ,  biosimilars are rarely used on the swiss market .  in norway ,  for example ,  almost all prescribed biologicals have been replaced by biosimilars .  in switzerland ,  only a few biosimilars are approved ,  and even if they are ,  doctors hardly every prescribe them .  but why ?  depending on who you ask ,  there is always somebody else to blame ,  which is usually the case in the swiss healthcare sector .          ( swissinfo . ch )        questions and answers on why the saving potential of biosimilars is not fully exploited: why do pharmaceutical companies rarely seek approval for biosimilars in switzerland ?  the swiss market is not attractive for biosimilars .  the national authorisation and supervisory authority for drugs and medical products ,  swissmedic ,  charges the same fee to approve biosimilars as for drugs containing new active substances .  the approval fee for biosimilars will only be cut in 2019 .  at the same time ,  companies are obliged to sell biosimilars 25% cheaper than the original drug .  what is surprising is that pharmaceutical companies can alter the production process of an original drug without renewing its approval .  they must simply inform the authorities .  so ,  it is cheaper to change an original drug than to introduce a new copy on the market . why do doctors and hospitals prescribe original drugs instead of biosimilars ?  there is no financial incentive for doctors and hospitals to prescribe the cheaper biosimilars .  it is more lucrative to keep offering the expensive originals .  according to the swiss medical association  ( fmh )  ,  doctors prefer to prescribe drugs which have been on the market longest and which they are more familiar with ,  as their main concern is patient safety . why don’t patients ask for the cheaper biosimilars ?  patients do not have to pay out a higher deductible for the expensive brand-name drug ,  as they do for other medicines for which generic versions exist .  pharmacists are also not allowed to substitute an expensive original biological product prescribed by a doctor or a hospital with a cheap copy ,  something which is possible with generic drugs .  there is no legal basis for biosimilars .  there are also medical concerns about changing medication during treatment . the federal council  ( executive body )  has become aware of this problem .  to eliminate the disincentives ,  it is currently reviewing the law .  “the amendments to be implemented and timeframe will depend on whether parliament passes or rejects the bill .  revising a law usually takes a minimum of three years , ” the federal office of public health said .  what is the solution ?  one thing is certain ,  this kind of legal revision is due to lead to lengthy discussions .  a committee against reference prices for drugs  ( gegenkomitee gegen referenzpreise )  has already been created .  while the notion of reference prices is very popular among health insurers ,  pharmaceutical companies are vehemently against them .  the pharma industry is more interested in creating incentives for doctors and patients to use biosimilars .  “we could offer flexible deductibles for patients ,  like we do for generic drugs , ” salzmann told swissinfo . ch .  “i also see possibilities to introduce different insurance models . ” this idea has met opposition from the health insurers .  at the press conference ,  jan triebel ,  deputy senior consultant of the rheumatology clinic at zurich’s triemli city hospital ,  reminded that pharmaceutical companies are limited companies and are therefore keen to sell at the highest possible price for their shareholders to make a profit .  “is it ethical to make money with human suffering ? ” asked triebel ,  without getting an answer to his own question .        us & swiss health series  what’s being done to bring down high drug costs ?        translated from germany by billi bierling       sign up for our free newsletters and get the top stories delivered to your inbox .    #mc_embed_signup div . response { margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em  . 5em  . 5em 0; font-weight: bold; float: left; top: -1 . 5em; z-index: 1; width: 80%;} label { display: inline; }    / * add your own mailchimp form style overrides in your site stylesheet or in this style block .  we recommend moving this block and the preceding css link to the head of your html file .  * /       email address     top stories  ( weekly )  latest news  ( daily )  business  ( weekly )  politics  ( weekly )  society  ( weekly )  fintech  ( biweekly )  multinationals  ( biweekly )  click here to see more newsletters              ( function ( $ )  {window . fnames = new array (  ) ; window . ftypes = new array (  ) ;fnames[0]= ' email ' ;ftypes[0]= ' email ' ;fnames[1]= ' fname ' ;ftypes[1]= ' text ' ;fnames[2]= ' lname ' ;ftypes[2]= ' text ' ;} ( jquery )  ) ;var $mcj = jquery . noconflict ( true ) ;      
__label__3     ‘swiss law first’ initiative given short shrift at polls - swi swissinfo . ch             opponents of the initiative have criticised the  ' swiss law first '  proposal as an attack on human rights .  ( keystone )        voters have rejected a right-wing proposal to put the swiss constitution above international law .  the ballot came after months of public debate on the divisive issue . the initiative was defeated with 66 . 2% of the vote ,  dealing a blow to the people ' s party which had launched the proposal .  it also failed to win a majority in any of the country’s 26 cantons . the people ' s party ,  which was pitted against all other major parties ,  the government ,  the business community and civil society ,  admitted defeat on sunday .  it argued that opponents had created uncertainty among citizens in the run-up to the vote through a campaign funded with "unlimited financial means" . for its part ,  a broad alliance of civil society groups said common sense had prevailed to defend basic human rights . the business community also welcomed the result saying voters wanted "a country open to the outside world" . justice minister simonetta sommaruga said sunday’s result confirmed previous decisions by voters to uphold a system of checks and balances between parliament ,  the government ,  the courts and the people . “voters do not want a rigid system which could create problems with international treaties .  parliament and the government can continue the current policy of finding solutions on a case-by-case basis , ” she told a news conference .       ballotvis (  ' https: /  / swissinfo-sheets . herokuapp . com '  ,   ' 1c-j77xnagficzvmflwvn3hzzkx1xt9qlsrye066vzgg '  )   . language (  ' eng '  )   . selectballots ( [ ' selbstbestimmungsinitiative ' ] )   . render ( document . getelementbyid (  ' ballot-vis '  )  ) ;   an online exit poll by the leading gfs bern research institute found that an overwhelming majority of respondents took an informed decision .  the researchers say the people’s party failed to win support outside its own ranks ,  notably among supporters of centrist and centre-right parties . the initiative was rejected notably because a majority of voters wanted pragmatic solution ,  according to the experts .  the survey was conducted among just over 9 , 281 respondents across switzerland between november 23- 25 .  + read how swiss voters living abroad votedeu ties and european courtthe people’s party said its initiative was aimed at preserving swiss sovereignty and direct democracy ,  giving citizens the final say on any international treaty . under the so-called “swiss law first” proposal ,  the powers of the government ,  parliament as well as the courts would have been restricted .  international accords which are not in line with the swiss constitution would have been cancelled or be subject to new negotiations . the initiative was launched in response to several rulings by the european court of human rights over the past decade on the expulsion of convicted foreign criminals by switzerland ,  as well as parliament’s refusal ,  backed by the supreme court ,  to implement an initiative approved by voters in 2010 ,  about the automatic deportation of criminals . hans-ueli vogt ,  people’s party parliamentarian and professor of law ,  said switzerland’s relations with the european union were the main target of the initiative . legal uncertainty ,  human rightsopponents ,  notably the government and the business community ,  warned that approval of the initiative would create legal uncertainty ,  thereby undermining switzerland’s position as a reliable partner .  a broad alliance from civil society also argued it is an attack on switzerland’s reputation as a champion of human rights . the people’s party has made the initiative a political priority ,  declaring it a showdown over fundamental values . the party presented a project for the initiative in august 2014 ,  seven months before beginning to collect the necessary 100 , 000 signatures in the spring of the following year .  the initiative immediately prompted harsh opposition ,  notably from human rights organisations .  parliament provided the stage for emotional discussions on the issue earlier this year ,  setting the tone for the vote campaign as early as september .  the debate saw broad coverage by the media and heated public panel discussions over the past two months . long campaignsthe unexpectedly moderate posters from the people’s party took opponents by surprise ,  but experts believe it was an effort to attract support from outside the party ranks ,  particularly among centrist voters . it’s estimated that both sides will have spent up to chf8 million  ( $8 million )  in total on campaign posters ,  leaflets ,  print advertisements and social media efforts – a potential record . however ,  experts doubted whether the new people’s party strategy could be successful ,  since opinion polls in the run-up to the november 25 vote found no majority for the initiative . results vote november 25 ,  2018‘swiss law first’ initiative:      33 . 8% yes      66 . 2% nocow horn initiative:               45 . 3% yes      54 . 7% nosocial welfare detectives:     64 . 7% yes      35 . 3% noturnout: 47 . 7%   swissinfo . ch       links   justice ministry  ' swiss law first '  initiative - people ' s party  ( german ,  french ,  italian )  vote november 25 ,  2018 - federal statistics office  ( german ,  french ,  italian )  gfs bern research and polling institute         sign up for our free newsletters and get the top stories delivered to your inbox .    #mc_embed_signup div . response { margin: 1em 0;

__label__1     no bonuses for horned cows ,  decide swiss voters - swi swissinfo . ch             thanks to the initiative ,  cow horns are now on the radar of the swiss and even international public .  ( keystone / dominic steinmann )        after 54 . 7% of voters said ‘no’ ,  the swiss constitution will not grant subsidies for livestock with horns . the proposal was one of the more unlikely issues in recent years to be put to a nationwide vote .   in order to pass ,  it would have required a majority of yes-votes among people as well as a majority of cantons .  six cantons approved the initiative ,  while 20 rejected it .       ballotvis (  ' https: /  / swissinfo-sheets . herokuapp . com '  ,   ' 1c-j77xnagficzvmflwvn3hzzkx1xt9qlsrye066vzgg '  )   . language (  ' eng '  )   . selectballots ( [ ' hornkuhinitiative ' ] )   . render ( document . getelementbyid (  ' ballot-vis '  )  ) ;   despite the postcard and advertising images suggesting otherwise ,  about three quarters of cows and a third of goats are hornless in switzerland ,  either because of their breed or a painful procedure to de-bud young animals as their horns start to grow .  many farmers don’t want horns because of the risk of injury and the fact that horned animals require more space ,  and hence larger barns . if voters had accepted the initiative ,  it would have been up to lawmakers to decide how much to pay farmers with horned animals ,  and how to finance the subsidies . “it was an initiative for cows and goats .  by voting ‘no’ ,  the people de-horned switzerland’s national animal .  they’ll have to explain that to the whole world , ” said mountain farmer armin capaul after rejection was clear . economics minister johann schneider-ammann noted that it was more practical for farmers to keep hornless animals .  “by saying no ,  the citizens have expressed their confidence in today’s agricultural policy , ” he said at a media conference after the final results were in . however ,  schneider-ammann pointed out that the result was not a rejection of horn-bearing cows and goats ,  and he praised capaul for launching a popular discussion of the issue . “armin capaul has shown that in our country ,  a person can practically launch an initiative singlehandedly and bring it to a vote .  hats off to him ! ”how it came about with determination reminiscent of bovine stubbornness ,  capaul initiated the vote on whether farmers who allow their cattle to grow horns should get a financial boost .  he argued that in addition to being painful ,  the de-horning procedure affects everything from milk quality to body temperature regulation to communication within the herd . in march 2016 ,  capaul presented a remarkable 120 , 000 petition signatures –supported by animal protection groups ,  environmentalists ,  adherents of anthroposophy as well as esoteric organisations – to the federal authorities . for a popular initiative to be put to a national vote ,  swiss law requires 100 , 000 signatures to be collected within 18 months . originally from canton graubünden in eastern switzerland ,  capaul now lives in the bernese jura – about an hour’s drive north-east of the swiss capital .  he invested over chf55 , 000  ( $55 , 030 )  of his own money on his quest to bring the issue to a vote .  his “hornkuh” website explains his motivation in five languages . the initiative also applied to goats .  “it’s even worse for goats to be de-horned – they have such thin scalps that it’s very painful , ” said capaul ,  who finds it kinder to breed hornless animals rather than remove the horns .                    podcast campaigning for cow horns     what a ‘yes’ would have meantaccording to pollsters ,  most supporters of the initiative came from grassroots factions within the centre-left green party and the conservative right people’s party who agreed with animal welfare arguments .  the swiss farmers’ association issued no formal vote recommendation to its members . in addition to concerns about the risk of horn-induced injuries ,  critics pointed out that horned cows are more likely to be tied to assigned mangers rather than moving around free-stall barns untethered .  indeed ,  capaul’s animals have assigned stalls and little freedom of movement in winter .  “in a free-stall barn they’d always be jostling for position .  that would be stressful for them , ” insisted capaul when swi visited in february 2016 ,  noting that they spend most of the summer outdoors . the swiss government – which had recommended that voters reject the initiative – estimated that it could have cost anywhere from chf10-30 million  ( $10-30 million )  per year .  it argued that farmers should be able to decide how to run their farms without being influenced by a financial incentive .  supporters countered that farmers still would have been free to run their farms as they saw fit ,  since the initiative would not have resulted in a ban on dehorning animals .  they had suggested taking the funds from the existing agricultural subsidy pool .  in 2017 ,  federal coffers paid out chf2 . 8 billion in direct subsidies to around 45 , 000 farms .  next steps for cow hornscapaul says that his “hornkuh” interest group is now considering its next move . “i’m not sad .  i did my part and i think the discussion will continue , ” capaul told swiss public television ,  srf ,  on sunday evening .  “we got more than a million yesses – that’s something !

__label__2     glaciers frozen in time - swi swissinfo . ch      photographer daniel schwartz has long been preoccupied with climate change .  the exhibition "glacier odyssey" in the museum of fine arts in chur is now showcasing pictures that reveal what is happening outside the museum doors . the inspiration for schwartz’s latest work was a stroll taken with his father to a place of childhood memories in the mountains of canton valais .  the view of today ' s rhone glacier compared to a photograph of a trip 50 years ago made the theme tangible: the ice flow that had grown over thousands of years was retreating - and practically dissolving before their eyes .  in the beginning was curiosity after this excursion schwartz returned home to solothurn ,  in northwestern switzerland .  he worked methodologically ,  studying maps and contacting glaciologists .  each project starts with research ,  curiosity and the desire to join the dots . the exhibition ties in with schwartz’s own life – his personal exploration of the alps -  and is therefore biographical .  he complements this with images of glacial regions in asia ,  africa and south america .  the pictures and maps in the exhibition show the glacier conditions from the last ice age and trace their decline over the last 200 years . art and factscommenting on the exhibition opening ,  schwartz said: “what you see on the museum walls today is the result of photo-journalistic work .  my work is based on facts .  with my camera ,  i go on location where i capture real-life results .  it has a socio-political relevance . ”by the end of the 21st century ,  most experts agree that hardly any trace of today’s alpine glaciers will remain .  politics always lags a step behind such developments .  and although art is often socially relevant ,  it is often reluctant to engage with what is happening every day . the exhibition in chur builds on daniel schwartz ' s project ,  which was published by thames&hudson in 2017 under the title "while the fires burn" .  the exhibition runs from november 10 ,  2018 until february 17 ,  2019 .           sign up for our free newsletters and get the top stories delivered to your inbox .    #mc_embed_signup div . response { margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em  . 5em  . 5em 0; font-weight: bold; float: left; top: -1 . 5em; z-index: 1; width: 80%;} label { display: inline; }    / * add your own mailchimp form style overrides in your site stylesheet or in this style block .  we recommend moving this block and the preceding css link to the head of your html file .  * /       email address     top stories  ( weekly )  latest news  ( daily )  business  ( weekly )  politics  ( weekly )  society  ( weekly )  fintech  ( biweekly )  multinationals  ( biweekly )  click here to see more newsletters              ( function ( $ )  {window . fnames = new array (  ) ; window . ftypes = new array (  ) ;fnames[0]= ' email ' ;ftypes[0]= ' email ' ;fnames[1]= ' fname ' ;ftypes[1]= ' text ' ;fnames[2]= ' lname ' ;ftypes[2]= ' text ' ;} ( jquery )  ) ;var $mcj = jquery . noconflict ( true ) ;

__label__11     ‘invest money’ to stop violence against women - swi swissinfo . ch             the #metoo movement has raised awareness about violence against women ,  but will sustainable solutions emerge ?  ( copyright 2016 the associated press .  all rights reserved .  )        one person dies every two weeks from domestic abuse in switzerland; most often ,  it’s a woman .  the swiss authorities must do more to implement the istanbul convention to combat this scourge ,  say campaigners .  since last year ,  the #metoo and #balancetonporc movements have put the spotlight on the problems of sexual abuse and harassment .  violence against women is not a new phenomenon ,  but it is a widespread and persistent human rights violation .  non-governmental groups place a great deal of hope in the council of europe convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence  ( better known as the istanbul convention )  ,  which entered into force in switzerland last april .  ahead of the united nations-supported international day for the elimination of violence against women on november 25 ,  swissinfo . ch talked to simone eggler of terre des femmes about the scale of the problem in switzerland and possible solutions .  eggler belongs to a new civil society network monitoring the implementation of the istanbul convention .  swissinfo . ch: what kinds of domestic abuse and other violence are reported in switzerland ? simone eggler: they are very different: physical ,  psychological ,  social and economic .  they can take place at home or in public .  sometimes it’s hard to separate them .  at the same time ,  we lack proper statistics .  there are lots of numbers on domestic abuse ,  but actual violence against women is not recorded .  one of our demands ,  which is also written in the istanbul convention ,  is to improve data collection and accuracy .  without this ,  we cannot monitor the situation and evaluate the effectiveness of the measures taken .  it’s the basis of everything .  swissinfo . ch: to what extent will implementing the istanbul convention improve things ? s . e . : the text requires switzerland to fulfil very specific obligations .  it’s essential that it’s implemented from a to z ,  because there are many gaps in switzerland .  we have lots of support structures ,  but they are not accessible to everyone .  refugees who are victims of violence during their flight ,  or people who were not established in the country at the time of the incident are not entitled to victim assistance in switzerland .  this is a serious flaw in the law .  we also have the problem of women who have the right to residency in switzerland through marriage .  if there is violence ,  often such women don’t want to separate from their husbands in order to avoid losing this right .  some cantons offer special measures to allow them to stay ,  but unfortunately not all of them do .  implementing the treaty should make it possible to close these gaps .  swissinfo . ch: what additional measures could ngos benefit from to help them in their work ? s . e . : under the istanbul convention ,  switzerland should set up a professional telephone helpline specialising in domestic abuse and violence against women ,  which can be reached 24 hours a day .  at certain times ,  the only option is to call the police .  sometimes this is necessary ,  but other times it is too big an obstacle for victims .  and in some cases ,  it is not the best solution .  a good system must be put in place to provide assistance that is accessible to everyone at all times .  swissinfo . ch: you also want improvements in the way people deal with those who carry out violence .  is there a typical profile of the people at risk of committing such acts ? s . e . : no ,  there is no typical profile of either the victim or the perpetrator .  violence is present in all social strata .  that is why offers of support must be accessible to all and without discrimination .  in switzerland ,  there are significant differences between cantons ,  which do not always have the same resources .  this must be harmonised to give everyone the same opportunities ,  whether in terms of prevention ,  protection ,  or working with those who carry out the abuse .  swissinfo . ch: what impact has the #metoo movement had in helping combat abuse ? s . e . : we have seen greater awareness of what constitutes violence ,  also on the part of the people caught up in it .  the issue is much more present in the media .  but it is important to go for long-term solutions over quick and emotional ones .  we often hear people saying you just need to give perpetrators tougher sentences .  but action at the criminal justice level does not solve anything .  you must also invest in improving support structures and research ,  but that’s expensive .  if you want to combat violence against women ,  you must invest money ,  otherwise you simply conceal the problem . according to the un ,  violence against women and girls is one of the most widespread ,  persistent and devastating human rights violations in our world today remains largely unreported due to the impunity ,  silence ,  stigma and shame surrounding it .  the un says that one in three women and girls experience physical or sexual violence in their lifetime ,  most frequently by an intimate partner .  half of women killed worldwide were killed by their partners or family in 2012; while only 1 out of 20 men were killed under similar circumstances .  just over half of women married or in a union freely make their own decisions about sexual relations ,  contraceptive use and health care .  worldwide ,  almost 750 million women and girls alive today were married before their 18th birthday; while 200 million women and girls have undergone female genital mutilation  ( fgm )  .   translated from french by simon bradley       sign up for our free newsletters and get the top stories delivered to your inbox .    #mc_embed_signup div . response { margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em  . 5em  . 5em 0; font-weight: bold; float: left; top: -1 . 5em; z-index: 1; width: 80%;} label { display: inline; }    / * add your own mailchimp form style overrides in your site stylesheet or in this style block .  we recommend moving this block and the preceding css link to the head of your html file .  * /       email address     top stories  ( weekly )  latest news  ( daily )  business  ( weekly )  politics  ( weekly )  society  ( weekly )  fintech  ( biweekly )  multinationals  ( biweekly )  click here to see more newsletters              ( function ( $ )  {window . fnames = new array (  ) ; window . ftypes = new array (  ) ;fnames[0]= ' email ' ;ftypes[0]= ' email ' ;fnames[1]= ' fname ' ;ftypes[1]= ' text ' ;fnames[2]= ' lname ' ;ftypes[2]= ' text ' ;} ( jquery )  ) ;var $mcj = jquery . noconflict ( true ) ;

( swissinfo . ch )        switzerland and liechtenstein: cow horn and skiingthis weekend’s three swiss ballot questions have triggered a lot of public debate as they touch on several of the country’s sore spots ,  from animal welfare to the limits of direct democracy and the welfare system .   while polls will close at noon on sunday ,  most swiss have already made their decision and delivered their ballots by postal mail or e-voting .   ( swissinfo . ch will have continuous coverage as the results come in on november 25 )  . switzerland’s smallest neighbour ,  the principality of liechtenstein ,  is delivering another example of modern direct democratic practice this weekend .        cow horns: one of three issues put to a nationwide vote in switzerland .   ( keystone )        this as a consequence of a parliamentary decision in september to sponsor the cross-country skiing world cup finals ,  known as “tour de ski” ,  with chf800 , 000  ( $806 , 500 )  in the coming years . a month later more than 1 , 700 signatures were delivered to the state chancellery  ( with a minimum of 1 , 000 out of totally 20 , 000 eligible voters )  ,  triggering the november 25 popular vote .  since 1919 ,  more than 100 nationwide votes on substantive issues have been held in liechtenstein ,  whose political system is a unique blend of absolute monarchy and modern direct democracy .  the monarch has the right to veto the people’s decisions while the citizens themselves can dismiss the prince via initiatives and at the ballot box . british columbia: election processan ocean and a continent away in british columbia ,  an electoral reform referendum is taking place . it is a fascinating example of a truly careful way of bringing citizens onto democracy’s centre stage via direct democracy .  in a process dating back to a representative citizens’ assembly in the early 2000s ,  more than 3 . 5 million voters in canada’s most western province will decide on the modernisation of their electoral process .        last year voters in vancouver ,  british columbia ,  decided on a proposed balloon ban .  this weekend citizens in the westernmost canadian province have the final say on a reform of the election system .

( keystone )        these popular votes include issues like same-sex marriage ,  lgbt rights ,  food security ,  nuclear power as well as the name of the taiwanese delegation to future olympic games .  the olympics issue offers insight into the specific challenges facing taiwan ,  one of the most vibrant democracies worldwide . since taiwan is a new participant in what could be considered the champions league of modern direct democracy ,  it will be especially interesting to observe and learn from this saturday’s ballot box exercise in which more than 200 , 000 poll workers will be deployed to receive and count hundreds of millions of ballots .  since the country has a history of vote buying and fraud during its pre-democratic times ,  every vote will have to be delivered and counted manually . except for british columbia’s referendum ,  where voting will end on november 30 ,  we will have all the results from this remarkable weekend by sunday night .  hopefully ,  both the winners and the losers of the individual races and referendums will feel they have benefited from this year’s champions league finals for modern direct democracy .    swissinfo . ch / p2p         sign up for our free newsletters and get the top stories delivered to your inbox .    #mc_embed_signup div . response { margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em  . 5em  . 5em 0; font-weight: bold; float: left; top: -1 . 5em; z-index: 1; width: 80%;} label { display: inline; }    / * add your own mailchimp form style overrides in your site stylesheet or in this style block .  we recommend moving this block and the preceding css link to the head of your html file .  * /       email address     top stories  ( weekly )  latest news  ( daily )  business  ( weekly )  politics  ( weekly )  society  ( weekly )  fintech  ( biweekly )  multinationals  ( biweekly )  click here to see more newsletters              ( function ( $ )  {window . fnames = new array (  ) ; window . ftypes = new array (  ) ;fnames[0]= ' email ' ;ftypes[0]= ' email ' ;fnames[1]= ' fname ' ;ftypes[1]= ' text ' ;fnames[2]= ' lname ' ;ftypes[2]= ' text ' ;} ( jquery )  ) ;var $mcj = jquery . noconflict ( true ) ;      
__label__9     bizarre or idealistic ?  swiss initiatives come in all forms - swi swissinfo . ch             simmental cow with horns - proud to be the subject of a nationwide vote in switzerland ?  ( gaetan bally / keystone )        as part of the country’s direct democratic system ,  swiss voters have a say on cow horns ,  hiking paths or even minarets: issues that may appear exotic and that sometimes attract worldwide attention . it’s often said that other countries look to switzerland with a mixture of envy and admiration because of the possibility to bring a wide variety of issues to a nationwide vote . indeed ,  the people’s initiative is a tenet of swiss democracy that gives citizens – in theory – the right to have the final say even on issues that can range from the seemingly minor to the utopian or revolutionary . the cow horn initiative ,  which will come to a vote on november 25 ,  is just the latest example .  who would have thought that a mountain farmer might force a nationwide vote on a constitutional amendment after collecting the necessary 100 , 000 signatures within 18 months ? for political scientist marc bühlmann from bern university ,  the horn cow initiative is proof of the functioning of the direct democratic system .  even if it means that seemingly secondary issues are enshrined in the swiss constitution ? it is a fundamental right of every swiss citizen to use the initiative as a tool to participate and engage in politics . environmental issuesa look back over recent history shows that issues related to traffic were high on the agenda of people’s concerns in the 1970s . an initiative calling for 12 car-free sundays per year was thrown out by voters in 1978; it was obviously considered a far-fetched idea .  but a year later ,  a constitutional amendment to promote footpaths and hiking trails won approval at the ballot box . another people’s initiative aimed at preventing the construction of three separate motorway sections in different parts of the country was rejected in 1990 amid warnings by the transport minister who saw switzerland’s road infrastructure at stake . but despite the rejection ,  it sent a signal to the authorities to take into account growing environmental concerns about traffic projects . army ,  holidaysan initiative to scrap switzerland’s armed forces was also rejected by voters but the impact of the 35 . 6% of yes votes in 1989 was considerable as it rocked the self-perception of a society with its traditional militia army system . the result prompted a series of reforms in the army ,  including a reduction in the number of troops ,  and the introduction of a civilian service . in more recent years ,  the rejection of an additional week’s statutory holidays per year by voters made many people outside switzerland shake their heads in disbelief . similarly ,  an initiative to introduce a guaranteed basic income did not win approval of swiss voters in 2016 . this leaves the question: does switzerland need more cow horns ? from religious slaughter practices to cow hornsban on religious slaugther: the first people’s initiative in modern swiss history came to a nationwide vote on august 20 ,  1893 .  it won voters’ approval with 60 . 1% .  the initiative was launched by cantonal animal protection groups and was aimed at banning the shechita practised by the jewish community . car-free sundays: the initiative wanted to introduce 12 car-free sundays per year .  it was rejected by 63 . 7% of voters on may 28 ,  1978 . promotion of footpaths: an initiative demanding the promotion of footpaths and hiking trails was withdrawn by the promoters .  but a counter-proposal was approved by voters with 77 . 6% in a nationwide ballot on february 18 ,  1979 . motorways: an environmental group tried to prevent the construction of a motorway section outside zurich by forcing a nationwide vote .  but the initiative ,  which also included projects in other parts of the country ,  failed to win a majority at the ballot box on april 1 ,  1990 .  as a result ,  the zurich bypass was opened in 2009 with considerable changes to the initial project . sunday initiative: the idea of four car-free sundays a year was rejected by 62 . 4% of voters on may 18 ,  2003 .  the promoters wanted to give priority to pedestrians and cyclists on roads and public squares as part of a four-year trial . minaret ban: the initiative was approved by 57 . 5% of voters on november 29 ,  2009 .  making international headlines ,  it bans the construction of new minarets across the country . more holidays: launched by the trade union group ,  travail suisse ,  the initiative called for minimum statutory holidays of six weeks annually .  two-thirds of voters rejected the proposal at the ballot box on march 11 ,  2012 . guaranteed basic income: the promoters of the initiative called for the introduction of a guaranteed basic income .  the idea was thrown out by voters with 76 . 9% on june 5 ,  2016 . cow horns: the promoters of the initiative demand government subsidies for farmers who keep cows and goats with horns .  the vote will take place on november 25 ,  2018 .        democracy toolbox   every three months ,  a revolution       adapted from german / urs ,   swissinfo . ch         sign up for our free newsletters and get the top stories delivered to your inbox .    #mc_embed_signup div . response { margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em  . 5em  . 5em 0; font-weight: bold; float: left; top: -1 . 5em; z-index: 1; width: 80%;} label { display: inline; }    / * add your own mailchimp form style overrides in your site stylesheet or in this style block .  we recommend moving this block and the preceding css link to the head of your html file .  * /       email address     top stories  ( weekly )  latest news  ( daily )  business  ( weekly )  politics  ( weekly )  society  ( weekly )  fintech  ( biweekly )  multinationals  ( biweekly )  click here to see more newsletters              ( function ( $ )  {window . fnames = new array (  ) ; window . ftypes = new array (  ) ;fnames[0]= ' email ' ;ftypes[0]= ' email ' ;fnames[1]= ' fname ' ;ftypes[1]= ' text ' ;fnames[2]= ' lname ' ;ftypes[2]= ' text ' ;} ( jquery )  ) ;var $mcj = jquery . noconflict ( true ) ;      
__label__11     swiss president chosen as ‘sign of the year’ by deaf society - swi swissinfo . ch             hard of hairing: swiss president alain berset introducing himself in sign language ( srf-swi )        humour is a universal language .  this is reflected in the swiss sign of the year ,  which pokes gentle fun at alain berset ,  who holds the rotating swiss presidency this year .  but what is the status of sign language in switzerland ?  in order to describe the swiss president accurately ,  you only need two things: a thumb and an index finger .  the gesture symbolises his lack of hair .         ( srf-swi )        since 2016 ,  the swiss deaf association has awarded a sign of the year in the german-speaking part of the country .  donald trump was the inaugural winner ,  with roger federer receiving the honour last year .                     alain berset  sign of the year      the sign for alain berset has established itself among swiss signers since his speech on swiss national day ,  august 1 ,  on the rütli meadow .  for the first time ,  the speeches and national anthem were interpreted in sign language .  this is a good example of the increased awareness for such needs .  but where does sign language currently stand in switzerland ?  sign languages are independent visual speech systems with their own grammars .  in switzerland they exist in the country’s three official languages: german ,  french and italian .  there are dialects too .  but signs are not just gesticulated versions of spoken languages .  like all languages ,  they have developed over time .  exact statistics don’t exist ,  but in switzerland there are an estimated 10 , 000 deaf people and 600 , 000 who are hard of hearing ,  many of whom use sign language .  demonstrations in 2014 switzerland ratified the united nations’ convention on the rights of persons with disabilities ,  which is intended to give people with disabilities the same rights as those without and enable them to participate in society .  contrary to the belief that people with disabilities are somehow “deficient” ,  the convention says they simply have different needs .  sign language is currently not a national language in switzerland .  it is mentioned only in the cantonal constitutions of geneva and zurich .  switzerland is thus failing to fulfil one of the un convention’s central points ,  argues the swiss deaf association ,  which describes both spoken as well as non-spoken languages as stand-alone ,  independent languages .  in sweden ,  by contrast ,  sign language is recognised as a minority language and in new zealand it is even an official language .  in autumn 2017 ,  deaf people and the hard of hearing demonstrated in switzerland ,  demanding political information be made available in sign language online .  some cities ,  such as bern ,  prove that that is possible: people communicate via sign-language videos online .  banned in schools for a long time sign language was decried in swiss schools as an inferior “monkey language” and was even banned in geneva and zurich until the 1980s and in st gallen until the 1990s .  teachers feared it would be a bad influence on the spoken language .  deaf or hearing-impaired children were punished if they signed during class – sometimes their fingers were beaten .  even in special schools ,  deaf or hearing-impaired children were forced to learn the spoken and written language .  today ,  these children are often integrated into mainstream schools .  this is not without problems: they can struggle to keep up with the lessons .  reaching higher education or university is a considerable challenge .  this is why lobbyists for deaf people are calling for more bilingual teaching:                 isabelle cicala   bilingual teacher for deaf people          ( translated from german by thomas stephens )  ,   swissinfo . ch         sign up for our free newsletters and get the top stories delivered to your inbox .    #mc_embed_signup div . response { margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em  . 5em  . 5em 0; font-weight: bold; float: left; top: -1 . 5em; z-index: 1; width: 80%;} label { display: inline; }    / * add your own mailchimp form style overrides in your site stylesheet or in this style block .  we recommend moving this block and the preceding css link to the head of your html file .  * /       email address     top stories  ( weekly )  latest news  ( daily )  business  ( weekly )  politics  ( weekly )  society  ( weekly )  fintech  ( biweekly )  multinationals  ( biweekly )  click here to see more newsletters              ( function ( $ )  {window . fnames = new array (  ) ; window . ftypes = new array (  ) ;fnames[0]= ' email ' ;ftypes[0]= ' email ' ;fnames[1]= ' fname ' ;ftypes[1]= ' text ' ;fnames[2]= ' lname ' ;ftypes[2]= ' text ' ;} ( jquery )  ) ;var $mcj = jquery . noconflict ( true ) ;

__label__9     how swiss cities could still improve rankings - swi swissinfo . ch             the seebad enge public bath in the centre of zurich ( keystone / ennio leanza )        swiss cities often rank highly in global quality-of-life surveys .  but when their urban policies come under closer scrutiny ,  how do they compare ? a recent study by the liberal think tank avenir suisse has taken a closer look at the urban policies of switzerland’s ten biggest cities and ranked them based on 47 indicators in eight specific areas ,  ranging from the quality of local administrative services to mobility and life-work balance .  avenir suisse “city monitoring” urban policy ranking  ( 2018 )  1 .  zurich: 64 . 7% of possible points; 2 .  basel: 62 . 8%; 3 .  bern: 62 . 7%; 4 .  lucerne: 58 . 3%; 5 .  st .  gallen: 53 . 8%; 6 .  winterthur: 52 . 8%; 7 .  lausanne: 49 . 3%; 8 .  biel: 48 . 9%; 9 .  lugano: 43 . 1%; 10 .  geneva: 38 . 8%as in the 2018 mercer quality-of-life survey ,  zurich came out top  ( with 64 . 7 points out of a total of 100 )  in the avenir suisse ranking .  it said zurich excelled in managing state budgets ,  and praised its cultural offerings and education policy ,  the city’s work-life balance and its business environment .  in recent years ,  the city ' s accounts have been balanced and “sufficient investments” have been made ,  avenir suisse said .  zurich’s business-friendly climate was helped by its traditionally strong banking sector ,  the federal institute of technology  ( eth zurich )  ,  the stock exchange and the international airport .        aerial view of zurich during the annual street parade music festival ( © keystone  /  ennio leanza )        the city’s high density of childcare facilities - 43 places per 100 pre-school children – also made it a good location for young working parents .  however ,  zurich was marked down for mobility – bicycles are used infrequently – and social policy .         view towards the basler münster cathedral from the herzog & de meuron-designed roche tower ,  the headquarters of the pharmaceutical company hoffmann-la roche ( © keystone  /  gaetan bally )        second-placed basel  ( 62 . 8 )  scored well in most areas ,  including the management of public funds ,  its business environment and social and integration policies .  avenir suisse said the local housing market was also regulated more effectively than in the other cities .         people take part in art performance about the death of coral by swiss artist pipilotti rist ,  held at a bern indoor swimming pool on october 7 ,  2018 ( © keystone  /  anthony anex )        bern  ( 62 . 7 )  also scored well for financial management .  researchers were particularly impressed by bern officials’ success in reducing the city’s debts .  bern also did well for having the “most liberal and efficient” cultural policy .  however ,  the report said bern was “not a very popular place of work for the private sector” and criticised officials’ excessive interventions in the local housing market .         a pedestrian walks across the "rathausbruecke" bridge in the centre of lucerne ( © keystone  /  gaetan bally )        in fourth position ,  lucerne  ( 58 . 3 )  scored top marks for its transport ,  energy and infrastructure policies .  ‘could do better’ at the bottom of the table was geneva  ( 38 . 8 )  .  although it scored well for its parks and public spaces ,  its housing market was described as “by far the most ineffective” .  it was also ranked last for its business environment and next to last for urban mobility ,  partly due to traffic problems in the city centre .         geneva was praised for its parks and public spaces ( © keystone  /  salvatore di nolfi )        avenir suisse said the city of calvin also had high administrative costs ,  which had increased by 10% per inhabitant between 2010 and 2016 .  the report was released as city council officials found themselves embroiled this month in an expenses scandal and accusations of “dishonest management of public interests” .  in an editorial in the tribune de genève newspaper ,  geneva minister pierre maudet criticised the study for its “numerous methodological errors and shortcomings ,  which showed a clear lack of knowledge of how french-speaking politics works ,  especially in geneva” .         an aerial view of lausanne ,  located on the northern shores on lake geneva ( keystone )        the other big city on lake geneva ,  lausanne ,  came seventh .  it was ranked highly for its welfare and cultural policies ,  start-up environment and green spaces ,  but scored badly for mobility ,  particularly its policy towards cyclists .  avenir suisse noted that communal employees are off sick on average 13 . 2 days a year – much more than in other cities .  local administration is also expensive and bureaucratic ,  it said .  for example ,  it takes over 200 days – one month more than other swiss cities – to be granted a building permit .  lausanne’s centre-left social democrat mayor ,  grégoire junod ,  dismissed the report ,  describing it as full of “errors ,  approximations and ideological bias” .  he criticised the fact that lausanne had been marked down for mobility because its public transport was considered too cheap ,  and that lausanne was ranked behind bern for its cultural offerings .         home away from home  basel and zug rated most popular swiss expat cities     “that will make the connoisseurs laugh , ” he commented .  renaissance and tax funds despite the disparities ,  the ten swiss cities – with over 50 , 000 citizens and mostly run by centre-left governments – generally got the thumbs up from the authors of the study .  unlike many big cities around the world ,  their public finances are mostly under control ,  with low debt levels ,  the 196-page report said .  administrations function reasonably well and the ten cities offer a high standard of infrastructure .  avenir suisse said swiss urban areas had enjoyed a renaissance thanks to economic reforms ,  the implementation of bilateral accords with the european union ,  an influx of highly qualified foreign workers and a reinvigorated property market .  new arrivals have helped money to pour into the coffers of switzerland’s cities ,  which has been spent on infrastructure ,  local administration and social programmes .  tax revenues for the ten biggest cities ,  for example ,  rose by an average of 50% per inhabitant between 1990-2016; in basel ,  the increase was over 90% .  “swiss cities have experienced a boom since the middle of the 1990s and their pull-factor continues today , ” avenir suisse director peter grünenfelder declared .  but there is still room for improvement ,  according to avenir suisse ,  which foresees major challenges ahead due to the diverse ,  aging and expanding populations in swiss cities ,  the changing structure of local administrations and their staff ,  and the rapid digitalisation of all aspects of modern life .         high standard of living  your views: why life is good in switzerland              sign up for our free newsletters and get the top

__label__9     switzerland’s global status is in jeopardy - swi swissinfo . ch             it was only after public protests that the swiss government withdrew plans to ease arms export rules .  ( keystone )        three recent swiss diplomatic controversies have raised questions about whether the small alpine country can still be considered a moral voice in world affairs ,  one that traditionally has been said to punch above its weight .       switzerland has always prided itself on being able to establish a place among larger countries because of its successful economy ,  historical neutrality and moral positions ,  including geneva’s being host to the international committee of the red cross  ( icrc )  and the united nations human rights council .  the comparative advantage of switzerland ,  particularly international geneva ,  as a unique platform for discussions such as the reagan-gorbachev summit during the cold war or the syrian peace talks have enhanced the swiss image in human rights and humanitarian issues . but three recent controversies have challenged this identity in global affairs: the refusal to sign a treaty banning the future use of nuclear weapons; a decision concerning selling arms to countries in conflict; and a global compact seeking to govern international migration .  while a justification for each of the decisions can be made ,  they raise questions about the future of the country’s carefully crafted identity . nuclear weapons banon november 1 ,  the first committee of the united nations general assembly passed a resolution supporting the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons .  more than 120 countries reaffirmed their support for the treaty ,  but switzerland was not among them ,  nor was it one of the countries which signed the agreement . the purpose of the treaty is clear and would appear to be consistent with swiss policies:“each state party undertakes never under any circumstances to: develop ,  test ,  produce ,  manufacture ,  otherwise acquire ,  possess or stockpile nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices; transfer to any recipient whatsoever nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices or control over such weapons or explosive devices directly or indirectly; receive the transfer of or control over nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices directly or indirectly . ”       daniel warner is a swiss-american political scientist and former deputy to the director ,  graduate institute ,  geneva .  ( courtesy )        in august ,  the federal council said it is not in favour of signing the treaty ,  a decision that was strongly criticized by annette willi ,  the president of the swiss division of ican ,  the international campaign to abolish nuclear weapons .   ( ican was the winner of the 2017 nobel peace prize )  . “the swiss position on this question has an international implication , ” willi said .  “as a swiss citizen ,  one must ask…if we are in the process of living the end of the great humanitarian tradition of our country . ” in late october ,  the foreign affairs committee of the swiss senate also voted against swiss adherence to the nuclear ban treaty ,  a further rejection of switzerland’s humanitarian tradition . arms salesa controversy over selling arms to countries in conflict has done nothing to improve switzerland’s image .  in june ,  switzerland announced that it would allow the sale of arms to countries in the grip of an “internal armed conflict , ” under certain conditions .  the swiss government said that “war materials” could be sold ,  but only if they were not used during an internal conflict .  however ,  it added ,  “it should now be possible to grant export authorisation if there is no reason to believe that the war materiel to be exported will be used in an internal armed conflict . ” the exemption “would not apply to countries plagued by civil war ,  like yemen or syria today , ” the government said .  amid an outcry ,  the government has changed its position . although switzerland is a neutral country ,  ruag ,  its biggest arms manufacturer ,  had its highest-ever business turnover in 2017 .  tension between business and values is never simple . amnesty international said of this tension: “amnesty international switzerland welcomes the recent decision of the swiss government to stop the announced change of the national export control system ,  which would have allowed sales of swiss arms to countries in armed conflict .  this decision comes late and only after huge public pressure . ”migration pactfinally ,  the swiss ambassador to the united nations in new york ,  jürg lauber ,  has been co-facilitator of a united nations migration compact for safe ,  orderly and regular migration .  amid the horrors of recent mass migration catastrophes ,  ambassador lauber has worked with juan jose gomez camacho ,  mexico’s ambassador to the un ,  since 2016 to try to improve the treatment of migrants and to diminish the destabilisation of the countries receiving them . in october ,  switzerland’s federal council approved the united nations global compact for migration .  the council said that that the agreement corresponds to switzerland’s interests in migration and its commitment to strengthening global migration governance .  ambassador lauber said ,  “this text puts migration firmly on the global agenda .  it will be a point of reference for years to come and induce real change on the ground . ”but on november 21 ,  the federal council changed its position ,  announcing that switzerland will not sign the document – which is politically but not legally binding – at an international conference in morocco in december .  instead ,  the swiss executive body put the decision on ice until parliament has debated the issue . for the federal council ,  which is under considerable pressure from the conservative right swiss people’s party ,  the situation is not evident politically .  in addition to parliament’s lack of a clear position so far ,  the government’s latest decision on the pact appears to discredit the work of its ambassador to the united nations and his work as co-facilitator .  although countries such as the united states ,  hungary and austria have already said they will not sign the compact ,  a refusal by switzerland to sign will be perceived as a swiss affront to the united nations and a rejection of its ambassador in new york . three controversies ,  three difficult decisions .  what is clear in each situation is that the historic human rights / humanitarian tradition of switzerland is now being contested in bern .  and that the moral position of switzerland that has been a foundation of its punching above its weight is being eroded .             nuclear ban  government’s stance on nuclear ban under scrutiny              sign up for our free newsletters and get the top stories delivered to your inbox .    #mc_embed_signup div . response { margin: 1em 0;

( keystone )        global pharmaceutical companies ,  including novartis and others based in switzerland ,  are increasingly turning to artificial intelligence to develop new drugs .  but this may not lead to lower prices . in 2013 ,  us start-up berg was asked by the department of defense to help improve the detection of prostate cancer ,  a disease common among pilots .  less than five years later ,  an artificial intelligence-driven tool has been tested on more than 1 , 000 patients with promising results . excitement about ai ,  machine learning and big data have prompted a boom in health-tech start-ups in a market traditionally dominated by big pharma .          despite debate over the extent to which ai will revolutionise medical science ,  billions are being bet on something revolutionary emerging to drive the next big leaps in drug developmentthis year has seen a jump in investment from big pharma and a range of joint ventures with health tech groups .  in 2018 ,  at least 15 companies have integrated ai into their drug discovery processes ,  according to deep knowledge analytics ,  an analysis company . “we’ve seen huge interest from many of the major pharma companies” in the past 18 months ,  says andrew hopkins ,  chief executive of exscientia ,  an ai-driven drug discovery company working with glaxosmithkline . other partnerships include astrazeneca’s and sanofi’s projects with berg ,  and merck’s work with numerate ,  another drug design company .  in-house developments include pfizer using ai to mine patient data — stored anonymously in electronic medical records — for signs of a rare form of heart failure .  novartis hopes a drug part-developed with ai will be registered within the next 36 months .                  20 years on  novartis: the making of a pharma giant      “we see ourselves shifting from the mindset of a traditional pharma company to [one] more inherently agile ,  typical of a tech company , ” says badhri srinivasan ,  novartis’s head of global development operations . about $5bn was invested in ai companies in 2016 ,  according to consultancy ip pragmatics ,  with healthcare one of the fastest growing sectors .  by 2021 ,  the value of the segment is expected to reach $6 . 6bn ,  with particular growth in china . in the uk ,  five new government-funded technology centres will open in 2019 ,  using ai to accelerate disease diagnosis with the aim of making the national health service more efficient . in early-stage drug discovery ,  start-ups such as benevolentai use algorithms to comb through enormous quantities of data for patterns humans alone might not find and generate new hypotheses to medical problems .  with hypotheses come potential solutions: companies such as insilico are using ai to design treatments not yet found in nature or chemical libraries; others use ai to simulate clinical trials ,  before selecting real-life candidates . the hunt for efficiencies is particularly important in an industry suffering from miserable statistics .  it takes an average of 12 years and costs of $2bn to bring a drug to market ,  and most clinical trials are unsuccessful .  according to a report from deloitte ,  projected returns on drug discovery r&d investment fell to their lowest level in eight years in 2017 ,  while spending increased . inefficiencies and inaccuracies mean “all we’re doing is magnifying the trial and error process , ” says niven narain ,  berg’s chief executive . high attrition rates are one of the reasons for expensive drug prices ,  as pharma companies look to offset the cost of failed projects against the few successful ones .  improving productivity “hopefully will have downstream effects” ,  says julie schiffman ,  vice-president of business analytics at pfizer . others are uncertain .  “ai won’t necessarily drive the cost of drugs down , ” says eric sandor ,  of genpact consulting’s pharmacovigilance division .  “what it will probably do is identify drugs that can be specifically formulated for small groups of patients  .   .   .  that are more specialised ,  which could therefore be more expensive . ”ai is not a silver bullet ,  says simon smith ,  chief growth officer at benchsci ,  an ai-driven biomedical search engine .  “the risk inherent in developing a drug isn’t going to go away just because you used a machine to do it , ” he says . despite the recent hype ,  there is a lack of ai specialists and “promising” drug discovery start-ups ,  according to deep knowledge analytics . moving beyond the “low-hanging fruit” to discoveries that make drug development drastically faster or cheaper will be “much harder” than achievements to date ,  says mr smith . it may be that current algorithms are focusing on the wrong things ,  he says .  “if the processes themselves aren’t going to make the next big breakthrough ,  it doesn’t matter if we expedite them by 100 times . ”copyright the financial times limited 2018       new technologies  ai has ‘enormous’ potential to transform health sector              sign up for our free newsletters and get the top stories delivered to your inbox .    #mc_embed_signup div . response { margin: 1em 0;

"universities can very much select their students to teacher training programmes .  if you want to be a classroom teacher in the finnish education system ,  you must in the best 10% of applicants to those university programmes . swissinfo: so you don ' t have a teacher shortage problem like we do in switzerland ? a . l . : we don’t ,  actually ,  because there is a high prestige to the profession and partly because of the training to a high level .  but it’s also because we treat our teachers as academic professionals in schools - they have great autonomy in their teaching ,  they are allowed their own teaching materials and also to decide how they teach the kids . swissinfo: but there was a little bit of a slip for finland in the last pisa study ,  for example .  a . l . : this is something the government and the schools are now working very hard on .  we now have a specific government-funded programme to upskill our teachers and to modernise the initial training of our teachers .  also for it training - so how to make best use of it in a pedagogical sense ,  not just bringing the devices into schools ,  but so teachers can enhance teaching and learning .  and then of course we have to train our teachers better to take the multicultural environment into account .  these are the kind of the issues that we need to improve upon for the future . swissinfo: what could finland learn from switzerland with regards to education ? a . l . : in finland ,  we especially admire swiss universities and the research and innovation system .  this is something that constantly brings our experts and our researchers to switzerland because you are among the best in the world here .         anita lehikoinen ,  permanent secretary at the ministry of education in finland ( isobel leybold )        and being a small country ,  you are very international ,  multicultural and multilingual and this is something that we want to learn from switzerland . swissinfo: what about apprenticeships ?  is that something that interests finland ? a . l . : we have actually reformed our vocational education and training  ( vet )  system .  the new legislation has been in force for nearly one year now and it was very much modelled according to swiss or german model in that we brought our vet very much closer to the world of work .  there ' s now close collaboration between business and industry and our education institutions ,  so you could say we now have more or less the apprenticeship idea behind the vet programmes . swissinfo: digitalisation is a bit of a buzzword in education ,  what can you say about that ? a . l . : it is indeed .  we have many other countries presenting their best in ed tech here at worlddidac .  i think we are now at a more sophisticated level in how we make use of digital devices and in the enhancing of teaching and learning performance .  that’s now how we make use of it .  we have here ,  for example ,  a robot that is teaching foreign languages to finnish kids in tampere [in remote northern finland] ,  so that’s one part of the future of education .  we need more and more blended learning ,  and increased remote learning capabilities so that even remote areas in our own countries and at global level can be reached .                     chatterbox  elias: the robot who ' ll try your favourite food         swiissinfo . ch         sign up for our free newsletters and get the top stories delivered to your inbox .    #mc_embed_signup div . response { margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em  . 5em  . 5em 0; font-weight: bold; float: left; top: -1 . 5em; z-index: 1; width: 80%;} label { display: inline; }    / * add your own mailchimp form style overrides in your site stylesheet or in this style block .  we recommend moving this block and the preceding css link to the head of your html file .  * /       email address     top stories  ( weekly )  latest news  ( daily )  business  ( weekly )  politics  ( weekly )  society  ( weekly )  fintech  ( biweekly )  multinationals  ( biweekly )  click here to see more newsletters              ( function ( $ )  {window . fnames = new array (  ) ; window . ftypes = new array (  ) ;fnames[0]= ' email ' ;ftypes[0]= ' email ' ;fnames[1]= ' fname ' ;ftypes[1]= ' text ' ;fnames[2]= ' lname ' ;ftypes[2]= ' text ' ;} ( jquery )  ) ;var $mcj = jquery . noconflict ( true ) ;      
__label__1     talking business in bosnia and uganda  - swi swissinfo . ch             there ' s a future in fish farming on lake victoria  ( swisscontact )        start-ups in developing countries have been getting some sound advice ,  thanks to the swiss .  the swisscontact development foundation ,  whose goal it is to improve the business environment in certain countries ,  recently reported back on projects creating jobs in bosnia and uganda . swisscontact ' s mission is “to promote economic ,  social ,  and environmental development by helping people integrate into local economic life" .  the foundation ,  set up in 1959 ,  has over 1 , 400 employees managing 123 projects in 36 countries .  it works closely with the private sector ,  but does not wage political campaigns ,  unlike some other swiss non-profit organisations . erna Šoševic from bosnia and david olyabo from lake victoria in uganda ,  were invited to speak at swisscontact’s annual meeting in zurich in october ,  and offered an insight into the hurdles they had to overcome to start up their businesses .  swisscontact wanted to provide some tangible examples of how its money gets spent .  bosnia: a transitional economy nearly a quarter of a century after a civil war in which 100 , 000 people died ,  bosnia and herzegovina remains one of europe’s poorest countries .  young entrepreneurs like erna Šoševic are forcing the pace of progress and challenging the norms of a traditional ,  male-dominated society . erna ,  a 34-year-old mother of two ,  left a steady job at a consulting agency to start her own business .  she developed bizbook ,  an online platform that helps innovative companies in bosnia to network with each other .  she says she learnt to become a ceo through swisscontact ' s entrepreneurship programme ,  funded by the state secretariat for economic affairs  ( seco )  .  the programme aims to create jobs by strengthening the entrepreneurship "ecosystem" through mentoring and training .                             bosnia modernises  from communism to it-led startups      uganda: a lack of investment in young peopleswisscontact is running a similar mentorship programme in tanzania and uganda: u-learn ,  funded by the mastercard foundation .  the project lasts until 2021 and aims to help a total of 15 , 000 youths .  so far ,  4 , 546 have been supported .  according to the central intelligence agency  ( cia )  world factbook for uganda ,  the east african country suffers from “poor economic management ,  endemic corruption ,  and the government’s failure to invest adequately in economic opportunities for a burgeoning young population” .  it relies on donor support to drive long-term growth .  under swisscontact ' s u-learn project ,  local trainers ,  master craftsmen and business owners are shown how to mentor and support young entrepreneurs .  24-year-old david olyabo from uganda received help from the programme to set up the fish farming business he now manages . living near lake victoria ,  david’s family made a living from fishing .  his brother paid david ' s university fees out of his salary ,  but when a ban was imposed on fishing in the lake due to depletion of stocks ,  david was forced to abandon his studies .  that’s when he got in touch with swisscontact for business advice .                            fishy business  sinking or swimming in a tough climate      david says the business group of 14 people has made chf8 , 826  ( $8 , 900 )  so far and by the end of the second production cycle ,  they expect to have tripled their earnings .  they have plans to cut costs by producing their own fish feed and want to expand the business by processing and exporting fish .  where swisscontact’s money comes froma long-standing united nations target is that developed countries should devote 0 . 7% of their gross national income to official development assistance ,  oda .  as you can see from the graph below ,  most of swisscontact ' s funding  ( 65% )  comes from “federal mandates” .  this refers to projects implemented on behalf of seco or the swiss agency for development and cooperation  ( sdc )  .  another 20% of their funding comes from “various clients” .  these are mandates from other state donors  ( for example ,  the uk’s department of international development ,  dfid ,  or the swedish equivalent ,  sida )  and multilateral organisations such as the world bank .  donations and contributions from private foundations and companies listed here in swisscontact’s annual report make up another 10% .         ( swissinfo . ch )        why businesses give so generouslycompanies that donate to legitimate charities can claim tax relief ,  deducting up to 20% of their revenues ,  but this is not a core motivation for charitable behaviour .  katrin schnellmann from swisscontact says philanthropy is usually part of corporate social responsibility  ( csr )  ,  a self-regulating business model that helps a company to remain socially accountable to itself and its stakeholders . the swiss-based pharmaceutical multinational ,  novartis ,  is one of swisscontact’s private donors .  it’s spokesman ,  satoshi jean-paul sugimoto ,  says philanthropy earns respect for the company ,  and is thereby more likely to enhance employee loyalty and attract better personnel to the firm: "we believe there is a  ( positive )  correlation between talent retention and attraction and being a good corporate citizen .  it is now clear that millennials ,  who make up over half the workforce in many countries ,  tend to have high expectations for corporate responsibility” . but giving to charity is only a small part of a company’s attractiveness ,  according to georg von schnurbein ,  director of the center for philanthropy studies at basel university .  “much more important are activities in environmental ,  societal ,  and for the past few years ,  political areas” .  novartis tends to support projects that are closely linked to its core business and expertise and are considered “sustainable” .  sugimoto explains , “our efforts focus on our own medicines and our scientific expertise to help healthcare systems achieve their healthcare goals more quickly and effectively” .  for example ,  novartis contributes to a swisscontact project linked to teaching paramedics in rural areas of bangladesh .          a community paramedic in bangladesh ,  trained thanks to swisscontact support .  ( swisscontact )        it ' s been suggested that big businesses “bank” their philanthropic activity to offset any future negative publicity .  von schnurbein rejects this idea .  he gives as an example carmakers that cheated emissions rules with illegal devices: “no one says about volkswagen in germany , “yes ,  they cheated ,  but look at all their charitable donations ! ”how successful are the start-ups funded by swisscontact ? with a budget of more than chf100 million in 2017 ,  most of it taxpayer’s money ,  the pressure is on to succeed .  but katrin schnellmann says ,  "success has to be evaluated on a case by case basis .  a swisscontact-supported start-up may cease to exist ,  but the entrepreneur might have ,  in the meantime ,  set up another successful business" . often swisscontact is not the only entity offering help .  for example ,  david with his fish farm in uganda received government aid following initial support from swisscontact .  the start-ups founded by david olyabo and and erna Šoševic are not only surviving but also expanding .  nevertheless ,  david ,  who also keeps chickens ,  is not putting all his eggs in one basket .  “if the fish farming business fails” ,  he says , ” i can earn a small income from poultry farming” .           sign up for our free newsletters and get the top stories delivered to your inbox .    #mc_embed_signup div . response { margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em  . 5em  . 5em 0; font-weight: bold; float: left; top: -1 . 5em; z-index: 1; width: 80%;} label { display: inline; }    / * add your own mailchimp form style overrides in your site stylesheet or in this style block .  we recommend moving this block and the preceding css link to the head of your html file .  * /       email address     top stories  ( weekly )  latest news  ( daily )  business  ( weekly )  politics  ( weekly )  society  ( weekly )  fintech  ( biweekly )  multinationals  ( biweekly )  click here to see more newsletters              ( function ( $ )  {window . fnames = new array (  ) ; window . ftypes = new array (  ) ;fnames[0]= ' email ' ;ftypes[0]= ' email ' ;fnames[1]= ' fname ' ;ftypes[1]= ' text ' ;fnames[2]= ' lname ' ;ftypes[2]= ' text ' ;} ( jquery )  ) ;var $mcj = jquery . noconflict ( true ) ;      
__label__8     canine cuddlability trumps pet patriotism - swi swissinfo . ch      what is the most popular dog breed in switzerland ?  not the big hairy swiss natives like the bernese mountain dog or the st bernard .  instead ,  the swiss opt for small ,  social media favourites like the chihuahua and bolonka zwetna . for years the large ,  long-haired labrador held the top spot ,  but in 2018 it was unseated by a dog that couldn’t be more different: the chihuahua . the handbag-size ,  bat-eared chihuahua ,  originally from mexico ,  is the most common dog breed in switzerland with 24 , 793 of the 551 , 412 dogs registered in the country ,  according to the swiss pet database amicus .  the only native swiss breed to make the top 12 is the bernese mountain dog in ninth position with 7 , 228 . practical and cuddlysmall dogs are more popular than ever ,  according to the sonntagszeitung .  one of the rising stars in 2018 is the bolonka zwetna ,  a member of the bichon dog family ,  which came in 12th place .  the small ,  furry breed gained international fame when prince george received one from his parents ,  the duke and duchess of cambridge ,  for his third birthday . only one bolonka was registered in switzerland in 2008 ,  but ten years later 5 , 050 are running around .  the breed is gaining popularity because it is small and practical but also loves to move and play ,  the paper said .  what’s more ,  it doesn’t shed much hair ,  loves attention and enjoys cuddling ,  making it popular among families and allergy sufferers .  a purebred bolonka with pedigree papers costs from around chf2 , 000  ( $2 , 005 )  to chf2 , 500 . chihuahuas outnumber bolonkas in switzerland almost five to one ,  but chihuahuas often end up in shelters .  in fact ,  no other breed is given away as often . another difference is that while both are often toted by social media influencers or stars ,  it is rare to see a bolonka dressed in costumes or glitzy accessories .  as one dog owner explained ,  bolonkas might wear a raincoat but that’s it . all images keystone-ats and afp       four-legged legend  barry the st bernard: from farm dog to national hero        swissinfo . ch         sign up for our free newsletters and get the top stories delivered to your inbox .    #mc_embed_signup div . response { margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em  . 5em  . 5em 0; font-weight: bold; float: left; top: -1 . 5em; z-index: 1; width: 80%;} label { display: inline; }    / * add your own mailchimp form style overrides in your site stylesheet or in this style block .  we recommend moving this block and the preceding css link to the head of your html file .  * /       email address     top stories  ( weekly )  latest news  ( daily )  business  ( weekly )  politics  ( weekly )  society  ( weekly )  fintech  ( biweekly )  multinationals  ( biweekly )  click here to see more newsletters              ( function ( $ )  {window . fnames = new array (  ) ; window . ftypes = new array (  ) ;fnames[0]= ' email ' ;ftypes[0]= ' email ' ;fnames[1]= ' fname ' ;ftypes[1]= ' text ' ;fnames[2]= ' lname ' ;ftypes[2]= ' text ' ;} ( jquery )  ) ;var $mcj = jquery . noconflict ( true ) ;

__label__2     old houses tell switzerland ' s story - swi swissinfo . ch      historically ,  rural swiss dwellings displayed a diversity of styles ,  depending on the local geography and building materials available .  a look at the archives . despite its relatively small area of just over 41 , 000 square kilometres  ( 15 , 444 square miles )  ,  switzerland’s rural building styles are as diverse as the many regional dialects of its four national languages . the country ' s mountainous terrain is a kind of geographical crossroads in europe ,  with regions north of the alps building mostly with timber ,  and those in the south using mainly stone .  in central switzerland ,  transitional regions use a mix of both materials . so ,  you might even be able to tell what region you’re in by taking a quick look at old buildings .  for example ,  while ticino dwellings are predominantly built from unaltered local stone ,  the houses in vaud are a mixture of timber and stone .  meanwhile ,  an 18th century farmhouse in aargau would be identifiable by its low walls and straw-thatched roof ,  while a similar residence in the emmental region of canton bern would be larger ,  with an attached stable ,  built of timber .  wood isn’t just wood !  there are many complex ways to build houses .  log homes are not the same as timber-built dwellings ,  for example .  log construction uses the horizontal trunks of coniferous trees .  in timber construction ,  the wood is positioned vertically .
