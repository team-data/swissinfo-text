__label__0 scholars from a country that doesn ' t allow churches or synagogues slam swiss minaret ban hypocrisy .  that is ,  it is hypocrisy from a western point of view .  as far as these "scholars" are concerned ,  islam is the truth ,  its truth is self-evident ,  and therefore the swiss are obligated to accommodate it in a way that the saudis are not obligated to accommodate non-muslim religious observance .  "saudi scholars slam swiss minaret ban , " by abdul rahman shaheen for gulf news ,  december 6  ( thanks to james ) : riyadh: several prominent saudi islamic scholars and preachers lambasted the recent swiss referendum to impose ban on the construction of mosque minarets in the country speaking to gulf news ,  they said that this is another evidence of the west ' s antagonism towards islam and such moves detail the serious initiatives being undertaken for holding dialogue among followers of various religions in different parts of the world .  shaikh abdul mohsen al shahri ,  an eminent scholar in islamic jurisprudence ,  said that the swiss referendum was part of a new hostile campaign unleashed against islam and muslims in the west .  "this is a clear evidence of the racial and religious segregation still prevails in the west ,  especially in a country ,  which boasts of an exemplary model of democratic ideals , " he said adding that this serves as a severe blow to the so called secular image of switzerland .  on his part ,  shaikh murshid al motairi ,  a noted saudi preacher ,  underlined the need for launching a massive campaign to withdraw investments of muslim countries from swiss banks and halt going to switzerland for holiday making .  now you ' re talkin '  ,  al-motairi !  more hypocrisy from the chief enemy of free speech in the world today ,  the oic: meanwhile ,  the secretary general of the organization of the islamic conference  ( oic )  prof .  ekmeliddin ihsanoglu voiced disappointment and concern over the swiss public referendum to ban building of minarets in the mosques in switzerland .  the secretary general of oic ,  which groups 57 muslim countries ,  qualified the ban as an unfortunate development that would tarnish the image of switzerland as a country upholding respect for diversity ,  freedom of religion and human rights .  he described this as the latest example of growing anti-islamic incitements in europe by the extremist ,  anti-immigrant ,  xenophobic ,  racist ,  scare-mongering ultra-right politicians who reign over common sense ,  wisdom and universal values .  the chief of oic ,  which represents about 1 . 5 billion muslims worldwide ,  expressed his deep regret that at a time when the muslim world and muslim societies around the world have been engaged in a struggle to fight extremism ,  the western societies are being hostage to extremists who exploit islam as a scapegoat and a springboard to develop their own political agenda which in turn contributes to polarization and fragmentation in the societies .  he stated that this move also highlighted the need for promoting genuine dialogue at the grass-roots level to alleviate all misunderstandings and misinformation that lead to intolerance and misconceptions

__label__0 the muslim world is not the opposition ,  as this article seems to state .  the educated world is stunned at the outcome of this situation .  not just because of its staunch interpretations to western civilization and its view of islam ,  but also because it shows a very obvious loophole in democratic society as a whole .  the majority voted for this descriminatory act .  is this a sign of a flaw in democracy ?  or a sign that the swiss people have become a racist populace ?  no .  neither are true .  this is a sign that we are not innocent as voters .  the public made the choice to discriminate against muslims in swiss society ,  i myself ,  think that the swiss society could learn a valuable lesson by being boycotted for this decision ,  to remind them that a vote is not just a personal opinion ,  but an action that demands a reaction .

__label__0 these comments reflects several things .  firstly ,  fear from the stronger culture of islam and muslims .  secondly ,  lack of self confidence in your own cultures .  thirdly ,  hypocrisy and double standard attitudes towards islam and developing countries in general .  forthly ,  total lack of tolerance and acceptance of the other ,  and this goes totally against any calls for dialogue between cultures and civilizations .  just a small reminder ,  it wasn ' t the muslims who killed 6 million jews in wwii ,  it was the europeans .  it wasn ' t the muslims who were responsible for killing more than 80 million people in wwi and ii .  .  . it was europe and the us .  it wasn ' t muslims who colonized countries all over africa and asia ,  and sucked all the natural and human resources to feed their endless appetite without paying any respect or understanding to the needs of the people of those colonized countries .  i have to tell you that your history and your present wars in iraq and afghanistan as well as in other parts of the world doesn ' t show that you have a better or civilized culture .  indeed christianity ,  judaism and islam are great religions and are superior to any indecent actions by their followers .

__label__0 thoughts on resolution of complex problems: when immigration gets out of control ,  as it has ,  it appears ,  in europe ,  generally ,  the indigenous folk begin to view the influx by and large ,  on the whole ,  somewhat ap . pre . hens . ive . ly .  the foregoing would seem to apply ,  especially ,  to immigrants of the muslim persuasion-- who seem to prefer "to have their  ' persuasion cake '  and eat it ,  too" ,  i . e .  take exception to "when in rome do as the romans" on every possible occasion .  it ' s accordingly perhaps understandable that the swiss prefer not to see muslim icons displayed-- symbols not high on the western world ' s current "hit parade" .  of course ,  folks who move from their nations of birth and don ' t aspire to adopt the ways of their respective nations of immigration ,  will seldom become properly assimilated ,  hence constitute primarily a potential source of aggravation .  "tolerance" can ' t readily be stretched to include manifestations of a presence "truly alien"  ( not simply one subject to positive change ,  for example ,  in a manner pygmalion )  .  what transpired in the u . s .  on september 11 ,  2001 ,  reflected a link between murderous action and a belief-- a link that has not been disestablished to date-- that is a source not of brotherhood--even of “live and let live”--but grief .  what can “we” do about that ?  quien sabe ?  but it’s a problem that can’t be ignored ,  that is ,  without unfortunate consequences  ( much more real than global warming )  that the civilized world can ill afford .

__label__0 democracy and human rights in switzerland are two different issues .  the country has only been democratic for a few decades  ( and only since the 1990s if one counts women voting in all elections )  .  the swiss define democracy merely as voting .  many other countries consider this no better than mob rule .  human rights ,  especially for the slightly more than half of the human race  ( women )  lag far behind .  women are routinely discriminated against by employers and banks ,  ooops swistzerland ' s dirty secret !  it ' s not that switzerland ' s image is tarnished ,  it ' s that the world is finally paying attention .

__label__0  '  ' the yes to the minaret ban is a sign that something is emotionally and culturally wrong in switzerland .  it is the sign of a society that has become weak .

__label__0 there is a simple solution .  when all the fragmented muslim organizations come together under one umbrella organization then lets sit down and talk about true integration with the swiss community not integration of swiss into the muslim religion .  firstly the different muslim organizations will never agree and come under one umbrella secondly islam never integrates it always stands alone and enforces its own teachings on the indigenous population .

__label__0 i had to laugh out loud when i read the ignorant anti-irish comments from the idiot below .  ireland already has a large muslim population that integrates well into the society here thank you .  they are not discriminated against here by the way .  furthermore talking about the catholic priest abuse is really like calling the kettle black when the largest european paedophile ring of recent years had its headquarters in st .  gallen .  also ,  the ira have been many things in their time but they never killed themselves through complete incompetence on fruitless training exercises .  it is common knowledge now that the only muslims that the swiss show any degree of respect for are the ones with the surname of gaddafi .  shame on switzerland .

__label__1 @ahmed ,  saudi arabia this is not racism .  there is no "race" factor involved .  this ban is a direct consequence of muslims screaming "allahu akbar" in the street and demanding sharia law - a very intolerant act to a society that has taken many muslims in and has given them so much in social benefits .  i see you are from saudi arabia ,  can the swiss come there and start building cathedrals ,  put up public displays of jesus dying on the cross ,  and can they hand out bibles to propagate christianity .  the answer is no !  !  in fact ,  apostasy and practicing christianity is prohibited and punishable by death .  please ,  we do not need your allegations of "hate .

__label__0 to call everyone who believes that the islamic world needs to be reformed and rights respected - a right-wing racist or fascist - gives an indication of the lack of tolerance on the other side of the debate .  when do eu politicians plan to approach the islamic world about their - behavior - when will we hear even a suggestion that - says the muslim treatment of christians and apostates from islam - is wrong - or even just - that it could possibly be wrong ?  so while the muslim world continues to deny freedoms - they now come as immigrants to europe - and try to introduce the same system of law - they have in the islamic world - and - without any support - politicians on the left across europe are considering giving it them .  that is why we have a wilders - that is why people are shifting to the right and center right in europe - the left is so politically correct - it even denies what the koran says .  we should believe them over what muslims are telling us - about wanting to takeover europe .  [there is even a koran verse to support this action] we are seeing problems with islam - from australia ,  to the us and canada ,  and around europe - is this a coincidence ?  the left has to understand - the people of europe will vote for someone or something - that tells them they are not dreaming - that this islamic emergence is real . 
__label__1 it ' s very typical for someone from the swiss people ' s party to deflect what is essentially an intolerance issue to the issue of direct democracy .  this man could be spinning any old line .  i don ' t see how he can back up his assertions that "the focus slipped very quickly from minarets to direct democracy" .  i ' m afraid to say that this article only shows that swissinfo has been hoodwinked and re-directed by a vile but clever politician .  direct democracy is great in the majority of cases ,  but surely it fails miserably as a voting system when it gives humans a chance to be intolerant ,  racist and xenophobic .  for questions like "should smoking be banned in public buildings ? " ,  "should we change the tax system to do this / that ? " ,  or "should we change speed limits on motorways to 160km / h  ( please ) " then direct democracy is great .  but for cases that allow humans to suppress minorities '  basic human rights or religious views and globally acceptable living habits ,  direct democracy simply becomes a poll for whether the voting group is intolerant ,  racist or xenophobic .  the answers to the last couple of questions for me says it all: "i distinguish three categories among muslims . " - the reason why he does this is because he distinguishes between different human beings ,  he "pigeon-holes" people ,  separates them out into different human categories and treats them differently .  this man thinks lower of some humans than he does of others .  if he didn ' t ,  then he wouldn ' t "distinguish three categories among muslims" .  "what gets us branded as racists is that we attack the dysfunctional behaviour imported through immigration" - this just simply isn ' t true ,  this man is trying to suggest to us why we brand the swiss people ' s party as racist .  i ' ll tell you why the world brands the swiss people ' s party as racist  ( and xenophobic )  ,  it ' s because they attack foreigners basic human rights and treat foreigners who live in switzerland like second class citizens .  and this fact isn ' t demonstrated more clearly than through their following 3 poster adverts: http: /  / bnp . org . uk / files / 2009 / 10 / swiss-poster-minarets . jpg http: /  / images . artnet . com / images_us / magazine / news / artnetnews / artnetnews5-30-08-3 . jpg http: /  / www . cbc . ca / gfx / photos / switzerland_referendumad_cp . jpg what could be more indefensible !  ?  andy
__label__0 the problem with having a "minimum of morality" is that each person has a different interpritation of what that should be .  while many of us can agree murder is immoral ,  issues like sexual expression ,  pornography ,  homosexuality ,  abortion ,  freedom of religion ,  etc .  are subject to vastly diverging views by the populace .  the history of the west is littered with governments and / or movements who have tried to immpose their own "minimum of morality" on reluctant populations .  as a result ,  we in the west are not only sceptical of attempts to impose a "minimum of morality" as a means to suppress the rights of individuals ,  we also have too many ancestors who died defending individual freedoms to allow these freedoms to be curtailed .  attempts by followers of islam to challenge or reduce these freedoms are considered by many an act of war .

__label__0 actually ,  there has been only a small increase in swiss property prices in the last 20 years or so .  that may change due to new laws which have been introduced to open up more areas to foreign buyers .  most swiss rent ,  i think it ' s somewhere around 70% and unfortunately most can only dream of being able to buy a property .  i prefer new zealand - people here are more relaxed .  even my other half ,  who is swiss ,  wouldn ' t go back there to live .  there are so many rules and regulations ,  which while ensuring that the country runs like clockwork ,  can be a bit stiffling if you ' re not used to them .  you can ' t even wash your car in your driveway unless you install a special drain !  we still have a holiday home there and enjoy going over for short periods ,  but are happy to come home to new zealand .

__label__1 the position set out in this article reporting that muslims are unhappy with certain aspects of the swiss vote on minarets or the facilities offered to train imams .  this is absolutely ridiculous ,  why would a christian country train muslim imams ?  is the same offered to christians in saudi arabia or any other muslim country ?  what would happen to anyone asking the saudi government to please set up courses to train catholic priests ?  it is ridiculous to ask this of a christian government .  if muslims want to train their imams send them to a muslim country do not foist the islamic religion onto the christian community or as that the universities paid for by a majority christian population should now pay to train muslim imams .  my experience of the vote against minarets is in sharp contract to mr afshar ' s everyone i have spoken to believes it is very positive and is backed even more by swiss people .  it is not acceptable to “muslim bash” however more and more people are no longer afraid of speaking out against what they see as a threat to their society .

__label__0 people complaining about high prices in migros / coop "forget" to mention their salaries and taxes .  the swiss economic model might not be "perfect" ,  but it ' s balanced ,  and it works quite well .  new big players introducing their own rules might disturb the balance .  therefore please don ' t blame mr bolliger for his "greediness": it ' s a bit more complicated than that .  having said that ,  i ' d insist that in the long term competition is a good thing .  migros and coop must improve their operations and sales ,  otherwise they ' ll have problems  ( and so will we all )  .  they won ' t do that just "for fun" ,  something will have to force them .  this is basically what happens .  a top manager scared of competition is a great thing . 
__label__0 edward ' s comment is hate speech and racist .  what is it doing on here ? 
__label__1 actually the world owes israel a war and some serious kick in terrorist israel ' s ass .  and i don ' t think these pro-israelis even read the article .  .  .  they just found it anti terrorist israel and started accusing it racist .  and they don ' t wanna realize that freedom fighting is not always terrorism
__label__0 have you asked yourself ,  margot ,  how it is that there are swimming pools ,  fountains ,  green trees and grass verges in israeli settlement towns ,  in the middle of a parched ,  dry land whose precious water resources are strategically diverted from palestinian lands ? 
__label__0 i seriously question the activities and involvement by the swiss government ministry stating and condemning the violence and use of force in iran and joining protests against china being very concerned about the situation of chinese dissident liu xiaobo .  where are these swiss government officials living ?  what are the priorities of the swiss government officials these days ?  how about the continuous criminal activities and violence committed against the swiss population ,  residents ,  business and tourist visitors in switzerland ?  today i am much more concerned and worried about the safety and well being of my siblings ,  relatives and the general population of switzerland who are threatened by criminal activity and violence committed on a daily basis all over switzerland by the guests of the swiss government . 
__label__0 at the beginning it was the jews who posed a threat to the europeans ,  then came the soviets ,  and recently the muslims .  as if the europeans ,  and the swiss included ,  can ' t live their life normally without having some sort of a threat to them on which they could project their negative feelings and hence get purified !  as a muslim living in switzerland ,  i so wish that the martians would soon come to earth and settle in europe so that this islamophobia gets put to an end .  but then i will not be able to deny my deep feelings of sympathy for the martians . 
__label__0 what a sad story .  but sadder still are the comments from those who insist on finding political bias where there is none . 
__label__0 this is not originally a french system ,  but it was started in the united states ,  and the french one is very similar to the original one .  anyone interested can find descriptions and history by looking for "amber alert" .  now ,  unlike the article would indicate ,  success rates have been low internationally ,  at least as far as homicide is concerned .  you ' ll find that of those children retrieved ,  almost all were abducted by parents ,  not random kidnapping killers .  there even has been a study done at the university of nevada that was fairly well covered by the media that suggested amber like warning systems have little to no effect in homicide cases or even cases where the child was likely to get hurt .  so far ,  no university has published results to the contrary or pointed out severe flaws in that study ,  so that can be considered the current scientific knowledge about amber alert type of systems .  i understand parents are concerned and want something done ,  but realistically ,  this might only likely help against their partners abducting children ,  not the faceless stranger .  that ' s a success of sorts ,  but not the one people think of .

__label__0 changes in u . s .  hospitalization and mortality rates following smoking bans this paper analyzes nationally representative databases ,  including the nationwide inpatient sample ,  to compare short-term changes in mortality and hospitalization rates in smoking-restricted regions with control regions .  in contrast with smaller regional studies ,  we find that workplace bans are not associated with statistically significant short-term declines in mortality or hospital admissions for myocardial infarction or other diseases .  an analysis simulating smaller studies using subsamples reveals that large short-term increases in myocardial infarction incidence following a workplace ban are as common as the large decreases reported in the published literature .  one of the latest in indianappolis found a rise in heart attacks .  this is just one more study by press release as in the helena study . 
__label__1 have you seen the study by nber researchers which found that heart attacks rates are just as likely to increase as to decrease after the imposition of smoking bans .  the study ,  changes in u . s hospitalization and mortality rates following smoking bans ,  concludes: "u . s .  state and local governments are increasingly restricting smoking in public places .  this paper analyzes nationally representative databases ,  including the nationwide inpatient sample ,  to compare short-term changes in mortality and hospitalization rates in smoking-restricted regions with control regions .  in contrast with smaller regional studies ,  we find that workplace bans are not associated with statistically significant short-term declines in mortality or hospital admissions for myocardial infarction or other diseases .  an analysis simulating smaller studies using subsamples reveals that large short-term increases in myocardial infarction incidence following a workplace ban are as common as the large decreases reported in the published literature . " the researchers further suggest: "we also show that there is wide year-to-year variation in myocardial infarction death and admission rates even in large regions such as counties and hospital catchment areas .  comparisons of small samples  ( which represent subsamples of our data and are similar to the samples used in the previous published literature )  might have led to atypical findings .  it is also possible that comparisons showing increases in cardiovascular events after a smoking ban were not submitted for publication because the results were considered implausible .  hence ,  the true distribution from single 23 regions would include both increases and decreases in events and a mean close to zero ,  while the published record would show only decreases in events .  thus ,  publication bias could plausibly explain why dramatic short-term public health improvements were seen in prior studies of smoking bans . " smoking ban opponents have long suspected that the cities chosen for smoking ban heart attack studies were cherry picked .  for instance ,  the illinois licensed beverage association warns on its website: "researchers can deliberately sift through enough small local jurisdictions with smoking bans to find a few aberrations in heart attack rates and then claim that elimination of exposure to secondhand smoke will dramatically reduce incidents of heart attacks .  please don ' t be taken in by misleading claims based on very select data samples . " http: /  / www . ilba . net / cgi-bin / ilba / info . pl ? domain=info&name=smokingban someone needs to look into this !  please find the nber study attached .

of humanity till today .  i agha dilbar authorize newspapers ,  magazines ,  internet ,  to publish and radio ,  t . v .  channels to broadcast this letter all round the world .  website: http: /  / aghadilbar . webs . com dear president barrack obama the great leader of the world i agha dilbar have sent mr .  president 100 registered research letters  ( 1000 new ideas to develop america and to change the world for peace and prosperity )  through embassy of usa islamabad till today and also direct sent these registered letters to whitehouse washington dc 20500 . these letters have been written on the guidelines of change we need .  and these letters are about the common men problems of respected american peoples and their solutions .  to end ,  economic recession ,  unemployment and to finish war ,  all round the world for peace and prosperity .  in these letters i have sent one thousand new scientific planning  / suggestions ,  about every walk of life for peace through friendship progress and prosperity all over the world .  my dear barack obama ,  the great leader of the world ,  my friend ,  my brother ,  provide an opportunity to agha dilbar to pay an official visit to america ,  that we two brothers sit together and by halting this horrible war .  in this war 1-million people have died from 9 / 11 till today ,  if this war continues ,  it will become the 111- world war . 200-million people would die ,  if 111-world war is triggered )  can take out 6 . 5 billion people of the world from abyss of destruction and then put them on the road to progress and prosperity .  dear president barrack obama considers ,  from 9 / 11 till today ,  america has conducted many war operations in connection with war on terror ,  resulting the circle of war has spread hundred times .  millions innocent persons have died .  in this war .  many more have been rendered homeless .  one lak  ( 10000 )  war affected youth joined the army of al-qaida and talban by the help of anti american countries have begun gorilla war in a horrible manner .  it is the result of wrong war strategy .  i agha dilbar desire to solve all above mentioned problems in a meeting with president barrack obama by adopting new revolutionary planning by bringing an end to present gorilla war in iraq ,  afghanistan and pakistan .  in the result the world can enter in a peaceful ,  advanced and progressive world ,  may it be so .  i agha dilbar have a new war strategy to achieve success through table talk between talban ,  pakistan and american gov .  90% of talban that are fighting against pak army belong from swat and tribal areas of nwfp .  i can provide america all realistic facts in such manner that their implementation could convert these talban into patriotic citizens of pakistan .  in this war strategy pakistan gov will never send his heavy artillery ,  tanks ,  cannons and air craft in war .  in this way 5-million persons will never displaced .  in the end talban by their will handover ,  their weapons to pakistan gov ,  they will come to table talk and suicide bombing will come to an end in pakistan .  through this war strategy pakistani and american gov can save expenses on war .  through this planning american and pakistani gov can utilize their saving on war budgets for development of schools ,  hospitals ,  colonies ,  markets ,  industry ,  roads ,  bridges ,  dams ,  canals of swat and tribal areas of nwfp that are war affected .  due to wrong war strategies of the american and nato forces .  the war on terror is getting worst mainly due to use of air craft ,  tanks ,  cannons .  because nine innocent people are killed for a single terrorist this way in these circumstances thousands of innocent people lose their life or properties and any other source of income .  in the result many people join terrorist or become suicide bomber .  as they think there is no other way to take revenge of the innocents killing of their relatives these are the basic reasons that hundreds of suicides are generated very quickly and easily in pakistan ,  afghanistan ,  iraq particularly who further kill thousands of other innocent public .  on account of present war strategy ,  billion dollars are being wasted yearly .  this war can cause fall of america instead of continuation of war my best suggestion for america must keep his supper power on the world and should conquer the world instead of war ,  but by his no-1 scientific technology spending on agriculture ,  industry ,  trade ,  education ,  scientific development and tourism ,  all round the world .  making an end to economic crisis in america .  a new global package is being offered for your kind honor .  america will have to make complete and final

__label__1 dubai became a symbol .  the ruler of dubai ,  the people of dubai ,  the investors in dubai ,  the breathless commentators on the wonder that is dubai ,  saw it as a symbol of all that was impressive ,  all that was so wonderful ,  all that bespoke of a bright future for the gulf .  others ,  however may choose to see things differently .  we may look at those "arpents de sable , " those acres of sand ,  and see dubai ,  or project dubai ,  or work-site dubai ,  as a symbol of something else .  yes ,  dubai does indeed represent what the arabs think of when they think of civilization .  it ' s what impresses them ,  what they think makes them just as advanced as we are ,  the inhabitants of rome or paris or london or new york .  they show the world ,  they think ,  that with their cloud-capped burj tower ,  they are as great ,  no greater ,  than those who put up skyscrapers in the west ,  or for that matter ,  in the east .  the luxury of their hotels ,  each trying to be more absurdly expensive than the next ,  catering to every idiotic whim and whimsy ,  are part of that "civilization of luxury" that the rich arabs ,  with their retrofitted and specially-made private 747s ,  and their planeloads of food flown in daily from hediard and fauchon ,  and their planeloads  ( or in the case of the arabs waiting off the coast in their yachts ,  boatloads )  of western paid ladies to service their every need ,  think of as "civilization" itself . 
__label__0 kokos ,  i really concure with you .  i live in switzerland as an immigrant and i am afraid to say racism is everywhere .  in public transport and in the streets .  i have seen many naturialised citizens that have fled this country . verbal abuse is the norm of the day .  there are alot of bars and clubs that are no go zones for the us . its even worse when somebody encounters the police force .  and the racism is particularly prone in the german speaking part of the country .  surprising thing is that no politician is speaking for our plight . 
__label__0 my heart aches for the pharma industry .  .  . can ' t rake in the money any more .  not to worry ,  with the help of the who ,  they ' ll come up with another world-wide  ' pandemic '  .  i am sure . 
__label__0 for vera in germany: honey ,  it ain ' t just the west .  this is the human condition and it ' s called sin .  pride ,  lust ,  power ,  greed -- "the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil . "
__label__0 i am convinced the current government of switzerland is taking the country towards banana republic .  switzerland has a court system and any country that wants information should go through the judicial system not back door deal with government officials
__label__1 that swissinfo publishes comments such as the one by "islam ,  ---" ?  is beyond my comprehension .  who is swissinfo representing ?  @islam: your hidden id is certainly identifying your commitment and task .  switzerland ,  watch out ! 
__label__0 i am moved by the courage these people had to resist and to act according to their conscience . 
__label__0 that guy that died as he had been binge drinking and then had an accident in the snow .  so why should ch be targeted for this ?  ?  ?  ?  is the responsibility not on the individual person .  you drink you take the risk . 
__label__1 i assume you mean brig and geneva .  .  .   ?  ?   ( first sentence third paragraph ) 
__label__1 is this swiss news ?  what are you guys at swissinfo smoking these days ?  get your act together and start producing comprehensive and relevant news related to switzerland ' s economy ,  business ,  political affairs and most of all the crime rate that has turned switzerland into a haven for primarily foreign criminals .  religious affairs and issues should be the last thing featured in your headlines . you have my email address and i expect some rational reply by your editorial staff to my accusations .

__label__1 perhaps stefi ,  us ,  would be interested in reading this article by journalist john pilger: http: /  / www . informationclearinghouse . info / article24519 . htm
__label__0 finally ,  a little common sense .  .  .  thank you mr .  hollenstine . 
__label__0 germany is committing a crime by aiding and abetting a criminal by purchasing stolen data .  .  .  . stealing is stealing and thats a crime .  .  .  . germany is trying to categorize levels of theft and that is something you would expect from mugabe .  .  .  .  . germany has lost its moral barometer
__label__0 there ' s but only one thing i can say about mr .  roger federer and his magnificant tennis game .  .  . he inspires me .  i am so inspired beyond what i could have ever imagined .  i have followed this man ' s career since 2004 .  roger .  .  . you have my respect ,  my admiration ,  and above all .  .  . my best wishes for a life filled with all that success and happiness affords .  may god truly bless you ,  mirka and your precious family .  always ,  mjr from the great upstate of south carolina ,  usa . 
__label__0 errebe ,  it ' s not swiss problem that germany can ' t control their own cash flows .  .  .  it ' s a problem of germany .  it ' s not somebody else guilt if you don ' t have proper tools to recieve taxes .  .  .  . 
__label__1 interesting to note the comments of those who defend islam .  do not use the word terrorist they say .  here in america the muslim threat is real .  muslims in the u . s . a .  try to gain special privileges not afforded to native born americans .  the demands of their religion are used to invoke a spirit of the muslim as the abused class .  as to why muslims want to live in countries other than their own native land ,  that is the question .  i would never conceive of living in a muslim country ,  since their view of christians ,  jews ,  and any citizen of other faiths ,  is not one of tolerance ,  or equals in humanity .  we are viewed as infidels ,  to be converted or destroyed .  how any muslim can accept that their religion is peaceful ,  goes beyond the scope of human reasoning .  allowing muslims to immigrate to any country will be the downfall of the human race .  read the koran ,  and understand how the muslim view of people not of the islamic belief system ,  then tell all the non islamic countries that islam is a relgion of peace .  the facts do not back their claim of peace ,  or their claim of a desire to become a coherent part of any society other than their own . 
__label__0 i for myself and all of you swiss should be fighting for one thing: the perseveration of our culture  ,  which is based on christianity - and not on islam .  while islamization of our society grows  ,  the political elite looks in the other direction and ignores the real problem  ,  namely  ,  the impending loss of our freedom  !  !  !  !  wake up  ,  switzerland  ,  and the rest of the christian countries  ,  before it is to late  !  !  !  !  ! 
__label__0 if anyone is interested in finding the truth about the german gold deposited in swiss banks during ww2 and the political shake down of these banks at the end of president clinton ' s term in office ,  they should read: "between the alps and a hard place" by angelo m .  codevilla .  mr .  codevilla is a professor of international relations at boston university and a former u . s .  foreign service officer .  the book is an expose of the shameful selling of historical truth and american foreign policy for political gain .  "when harsh accusations depart too far from the truth they leave bitter consequenses" tacitus .  the united states put  ' the muscle '  on switzerland without any solid evidence to back the accusations . 
__label__0 most western nations if not all ,  face huge numbers of illegal immigrants .  kosovars are no exception and despite switzerland being home for many kosovars ,  those who are in the country illegaly ,  should be returned to kosovo .  deportation is a sensitive issue ,  however unless nations take measures to stop illegal immigration ,  the message illegal immigrants get ,  is that it is perfectly alright to settle anywhere in europe and / or north america .  the us is working hard to stop illegal immigration and deportation cannot be avoided if caught .  thus ,  switzerland is proceeding within its rule of law ,  by deporting illegal kosovars back to kosovo . 
__label__1 another joke by minister eveline widmer-schlumpf and more insults to the swiss citizens .  170 , 000 kosovars living in switzerland and only a couple of dozen people will be affected by this extradition agreement ?  the swiss jails and penitentiaries must be  ( are )  occupied by an extremely high percentage of criminals of kosovo origin and heritage .  how about sending them home forever . 
__label__0 thank you switzerland .  thank you for realizing the great danger of pfdj to the horn in general and the eritrean people in particular .  i have no double the rest of the world will follow your foot steps . 
__label__0 this action by the swiss government reveals nothing but its obeyance to the rerrorist country ( usa ) which means lack of sovereign decision in switzerland . 
__label__0 @daniel p: i seriously question whether the tax burden which germans bear was actually "democratically decided . " did the german people actually get to vote for the tax levels currently demanded of them by their governments ?  us voters were certainly never allowed to vote on the tax system which now routinely plunders their property .  in fact ,  wherever a country ' s tax structure is truly "democratically decided , " one can safely expect the government to be strictly limited in size ,  scope ,  and power . 
__label__0 sadly the third reich lives on in the usa .  1 in 95 americans are in jail ,  elementary schools are covered in cctv cameras .  demand a return to the gold standard before world war 4 comes to your side of the mediterranian .  tell big brother to go to hell . 
__label__0 lloyd-- you have yourself answered the dilemma !  there is a technical *difference* between bank secrecy ,  and tax evasion vs fraud .  if you havent done anything wrong ,  theres nothing to "hide" from the authorities  ( not that this means exposing yourself to the bad world out there )  ,  but then you have nothing to fear .  actively supporting tax evasion  ( not a crime here )  is an absolute no-no .  .  and while your good banker rejects suitcases of "bad" money ,  ask him how many of his colleagues would do the same ?  ?  what if the amounts involved are in 10s of millions ,  and that they are assured of a small percentage cut in the deal ,  how about peer pressure ,  "industry standards" .  .  big bank here  ( or at least a bunch of individuals )  actively did this in us .  dont tell me that these guys could manage to swindle such money without anyone else noticing it !  we are not talking of peanuts stolen for a few hours !  !  when the game is exposed ,  theres a lot of blah-blah in public / parliament / media .  but then we are back to square on of essentially doing the same "business" .  just come clean .  its not that difficult !  actually its better for a healthy swiss banking system .  all the anti-money-washing ,  know your client drives ,  etc .  .  work smoothly when smaller amounts are involved .  temptation and greed a great virtues in this game !  and like the recent case of haitian dictator ,  the government / parliament can always stop / restrict / halt illegal data transfers .  but if we know that a bank has supported tax evasion in foreign lands ,  its imperative on us to stop this at the source .  and this is not a question of "sacrificing bank secrecy" .  theres no such thing ,  else you wouldnt have seen cd vendors selling them in markets .  imagine what happens if the vendors sell them in black / gray markets to gang lords who then blackmail these clients ?  ?  would the bank ,  swiss govt ,  or any other govt be able to help these guys out ,  since everything is "secret" ?  ? 
__label__0 agreed that data theft is "theft" .  but isnt encouraging foreigners to evade legal taxes in their countries and helping them to do so ,  also a "theft of money from its rightful owners  ( the citizens of that country ) " ?  ?  we swiss conveniently tend to ignore this .  .  when our bankers claim big bonuses for all the profit they got ,  we cry foul-play !  !  but when the same bankers help other foreigners to cheat their people ,  and someone raises alarm ,  suddenly our swiss nationalism gains momentum .  funny ,  isnt it ?  same events ,  but different perceptions at different times .  just scrap the tax-fraud tax-evasion distinction .  a cheat is a cheat is a cheat !  moreover ,  swiss banking is *much much* more than just secret number accounts & dictatorail monies .  come clean & many more people will appreciate your business model . 
__label__0 here we go again - where does this picking on switzerland ' s banking system end ?  numbered accounts within the banking system of any countries in the world do exist .  canada per-see is no exception and so is the usa .  how often do we here from the media that a transnational company has purchased a domestic company for an “undisclosed” amount of money or at an auction that a multi-million dollar purchase of a famous artwork has been sold to an “unknown” buyer ?  - .  will we ever know where this money came from and whether it is a part of tax-free money ?  i urge the media to stop pointing the finger to switzerland only but conveniently miss to do due diligence by hiding the fact that today’s governments in any country have ,  unfortunately ,  become the underdogs of “big business ,  too big to fail” .  odette ,  canada
__label__1 "married women are not given equal rights in their joint bank accounts"-dr mo ,  switzerland your absolutely right dr mo ,  women aren ' t given equal rights ,  they ' re given favoritism .  case in point ,  child support .  why should it be the woman who gets to keep the fathers child ,  and the dad who pays child support .  how often does the dad get to keep his kid ,  and the delinquent mother pay child support ?  it happened to my dad  ( who loved me dearly )  .  i ' m in california ,  and under our system ,  i ' m never getting married .  i ' d be nuts to .  bitches ! 
__label__0 how many 3rd world dictators  ( some of which are dead )  ,  kings and drug lords have such accounts in switzerland ,  while their people live under the poverty line ?  it ' s a big-fish-eat-small-fish world . 
__label__0 the site is still up !  http: /  / www . skichalet-verbier . com /  chalet lumiere chemin de vernes 1936 verbier switzerland . 
__label__0 more regulation ,  yes ,  definitively .  but not in the french style proposed by mr .  sarkosy ,  which makes an unhealthy confusion between politics and economy .  when a power eager government tries to control all aspects of the economy ,  there is only little room left for private initiatives which is the sole engine for development .  the spectacular growth of china is only due the opening of their economy to more liberalism .  have those people in davos already forgotten the role of the rating agencies who misled the financial world into taking excessive risks ,  investing in toxic assets ?  the same agencies are today granting a triple a to the country of mr .  sarkosy ,  allowing him to increase the public debt .  have they had a close look at the solvability of a country with an overstated gdp due to an excessive proportion of public spending  ( of which a good part is not wealth creation )  ,  and an understated public debt which does not take into account the financing of future retirement obligations  ?  the next crisis might come from government’s bankruptcies ,  and not necessarily from the ones apparently in trouble today .  finally what is more unethical ,  a government confiscating the majority of wealth created by it’s citizens to waste it on inefficient public spending ,  or an individual hiding part of the wealth he created from a government with abusive fiscal policies  ? 
__label__0 what a lovely ,  uplifting story and a great tribute to margrit meier ,  a swiss and global pioneer for women ' s sports !  bravo !

__label__0 thanks again for the wonderfully balanced and impartial report and the thinly disguised propaganda against the swiss people ' s party .  your site is a political platform . 
__label__0 what about the swiss people ' s party phobia exhibited here ? 
__label__0 how do you describe this absurd treatment of 1 a son of an african country leader ,  col .  ghiddafi 2 a diplomat ,  3 a resident and a known icon of frequent travels to the country ,  be a ) treated like a criminal for an offence that in true fact was masterminded by nobodies ,  by people and lawyers who are money hungry ,  by people who hate the man ,  by people who listen to one story from one angel ,  and the way the siege was conducted clearly describes that this was the case .  for crying out loud people ,  libya is or was rather a neutral friend of switzerland for decades ,  let alone it fueled the swiss banking economy in many ways .  one very important matter everyone is overlooking is the fact that people are dying because of illnesses .  we will never deny that there are professors of medicine who are totally against this very funny episode of ludicrous politics ,  doctors who treat people with respect ,  and many libyans  ,  non diplomatic non rich non political are in the process paying the ultimate price for switzerland foolish aristocracy of politics .  one needs to first be open to critiszim to find out that greed was the winner of this episode . 
__label__0 the eu has remained completely silent in this whole matter and now want to complain  !  !  !  damn  !  !  !  they only had to stop this idiot ghadafi and not play his little game .  no ,  switzerland does not budge from her position until we get our 2 citizens returned to switzerland safely and that we get a formal apology from that fool for all the threats he has proferred against this country !  !  enough is enough ! 
__label__0 i would recomend to some of your readers to know thier history before equating my country libya with that dictator ghadaffi ,  may i also remind everyone that we the libyan people never voted for him and as a result we have been suffering his brutality for over 40 years ,  i can ' t fault the swiss for wanting to retaliate but with someone like ghadaffi the rules of the game change ,  and unfortunately now that he has been welcomed with open arms to the west as the role model to be followed no one can stop him ,  i do hope that the 2 swiss hostages are released as they are innocent bystanders in ghadaffis ' s game ,  but please remember that what you ' re witnessing now with ghadaffi the libyans have been living with day in day out ,  with daily terror and intimidation by him and his lunatic sons and his whole regime ,  so please take this matter with your elected governments who continue to do business with him on the expense of libyan lives ,  if you want oil in europe he will give it to you but it comes with a price ,  he cannot be trusted and will continue to act as he pleases as long as your elected leaders continue to bend over for him
__label__0 @bmorant the only one who ' s dumping manure is the libyan regime ,  who reacted in a childish way when one of the colonel ' s brats misbehaved in geneva .  i find it frankly unbelievable that any european country decides to turn a blind eye to that and merrily goes on making money with that terrorist .  of course the situation was badly handled by the swiss ,  but to blame them for using all possible means to repatriate their hostages is ,  in all honesty ,  not particularly honourable .  the so-called visa "ban" is not a real one for countries other than ch ,  since libyans can get national visas .  and if the schengen system was not meant to allow vetoes by participating states ,  then why is the ch procedure completely within the legal bounds of the treaty ?  ? 
__label__0 my opinion is that we do not hold europe hostage .  we only exercise the very rights we agreed upon in the schengen treaties ,  which we did not write but only signed into  ( we can ' t somehow have deceived the co-signing parties by clever formulation ,  at least )  .  what is decided by the schengen treaties is that border controls only happen at the outskirts of the area  ( the geographical "outside" ,  plus airports and such )  .  but they have the provision that if a nation doesn ' t like certain people ,  they can blacklist them - at which point these people will have to apply for national visa and not get a free pass to the whole area anymore .  this keeps control of immigration for all signatories at around the same level as it used to be before the treaty .  so it is not like they can ' t enter all of europe anymore .  it is just that they can ' t get simple access to "all of the schengen area"  ( which includes switzerland )  .  this is our right ,  and it is used as intended - we only blacklisted 188 people out of 6 . 5 million ,  the real undesirables .  any european or non-european nation can of course still grant them visa if they want ,  but they need to keep them  ( hard to police with no border controls ,  but that ' s their problem )  .  as for the economy ,  how does that work ?  switzerland has more people than libya  ( who ,  by the way ,  have quite a direct say in politics ,  whereas libya is a dictatorship and if he ever gets dropped ,  everything may change in foreign politics )  and a gdp three times as large - mostly of course from doing various jobs companies somehow working with europe .  if that were the contest ,  i can ' t see how libya would "win" ,  despite having some oil reserves . 
__label__0 for the austrian gentleman who is waiting for another unjustified war on libya from the us .  i tell him rest assured you and others who hide behind the us .  biggest us trade delegation will visit libya next sunday .  in fact ,  this serves the american not the eu .  cheers ! 
__label__0 switzerland and the european union have every right to refuse visas to lybian ' s .  after-all ,  lybia does not have the best human rights record .  it is rather unfortunate for lybia to deny entry to europeans who hold valid tourist visas ,  and turn them back at point of entry such as airports ,  ports ,  etc .  lybia does not seem to be evaluating things from an ethical prespective .  the european union and switzerland should cease from dealings with lybia .  the oil rich nation would suffer greatly if either the european union and / or switzerland ceased from importing oil . 
__label__0 about 1500 years ago the so-called medieval warming took place with higher temperatures than we are experiencing today .  the current claim is the greatest hoax of all time with the sole purpose to impose taxing energy at the household level thereby making billions for al gore ,  inc .  controlling the world ' s population would be a by product . cyclical warm and cold times have occurred for millions of years and largely without human presence . 
__label__0 have not the swiss learned the simple lesson that the only way to deal with tin pot bullies like gaddifi is to stand up to them and then teach them a lesson tht they will never forget ?  roger
__label__0 in the face of outrageous bluster from a libyan official:  '  .  .  . the swiss list is a big insult to the libyan people and their leader col .  al-gaddafi ,  and hinted that libya would ask the arab countries at the arab summit that will be held in tripoli at the end of next month to take what is necessary for putting an end to "the swiss arrogance toward libya ,  '  it is good to note that micheline calmy-rey is demonstrating a high degree of leadership vis-à-vis the  ' criminals and terrorists '  out of libya .  however ,  it would appear that the criminals and terrorists out of libya ,  have yet to be suitably convinced into accepting that they cannot use their perceived position of importance ,  to ride roughshod over the swiss ,  et al ,  at will .  in stark contrast to micheline calmy-rey ,  the position of the italians ,  as per franco frattini ,  would make a  ' surrender monkey '  blush:  ' schengen is meant to protect its members from criminals and terrorists ,  and the swiss should use other means to resolve bilateral problems with libya .  ' 
__label__0 why are there no "child-proof" safety caps on these products and medicines in switzerland ?  this is a simple precaution that not only prevents young children from access but also causes adults to think a bit longer when opening such a product .  such safety caps have been standard in the us for decades on many products  ( and all medicines )  and are overdue here .  there are many other safety issues that are lax in switzerland . 
__label__1 @sandro ,  italy  .  .  .  as much as i want to believe your story ,  one has to realise one thing .  these 2 men are simply employees of companies who have vested interest there and were simply doing their work .  there was ni illicit business dealings ,  and their visas would have been controlled upon entry if they were not satisfactory .  i am just applying simple logic  .  .  .  not the hyped press coverage .  so logically ,  no foul  .  .  .  which leaves one asking  .  .  .  why then were they arrested  ?  ?  and here the reason is obvious  !  one thing many seem to forget completely is this ,  the brat was here in private citizen capacity and comitted a crime .  ok ,  a leaked photo  .  .  .  fine  .  .  .  but this does not detract from the fact that a crime was comitted .  why does the world seem to ignore this fact .  this is a crime that is prosecuted with or without a charge laid .  why should this little punk benefit from any preferential treatment  ?  because he is ghadafi ' s son  .  .  .   ?  ?  ?  i couldn ' t care less if he was the queen of sheba  .  .  .  if not on declared official business ,  the law of the land is the highest law .  this is the long and short of it all .  no bias ,  no gloss and no twisted facts .  there are many libyans in our jails who have comitted crimes  .  .  theft and agressions  .  .  .  and no noise is made for them ,  it is just because this libyan is the dictators spoiled brat .  there is nothing more to this  .  .  .  göldi is now only a pawn and will not be released until the case against the son is dropped and the geneva police are brought to book for doing their job .  and to boot ,  they still want compensation and an apology  !  !  !  i think gadaffi and his spawn can go to hell . 
__label__0 these are all perceptions - the swiss see it one way - the lybians the other .  the fact remains that the lybian chief ' s son beat up his personnel in a public hotel and was asked to quiet down and talk .  this offer was refused and ensuing the son and wife were brought to the police station ,  questioned and made a statement .  there were detained in a private house until the issue was cleared .  is that the way to behave in a foreign country .  we would not be discussing this issue ,  if that fact was not true .  to take 2 innocent men who are doing a job to improve the lybian economy through works of constuction and engineering and lock them up and hold them for more than 19 months - liberate one and lock the other in jail ,  gives a lot of food for thought and perceptions on correct behaviour . 
__label__0 official switzerland already expressed its sincere regret for the publication of the police photos .  there also won ' t be any problem doing that again ,  so that ' s not going to be the problem .  i ,  however ,  don ' t get how we could track down prosecute and punish whoever is guilty "according to a timetable" and promise compensation in advance .  our law already specifies what punishments is awarded on which transgressions - if it doesn ' t already carry a fee or compensation for the victims ,  then that ' s not something a judge can with a conviction .  additionally ,  the "timetable" is more or less also already defined by our law - cases come with the right to appeal and such but couldn ' t be drawn out infinitely either way .  so either they don ' t really get that this is already covered by us ,  or -more likely- they want something else .  .  .  if tripoli and / or the eu diplomats want anything in the ways of compensation that is not based entirely on our law ,  then i feel they should better seek to get it from our politics  /  diplomacy ,  not from our justice - unlike the earlier ,  the latter do have the power to grant money "at random" . 
__label__0 calling for a jihad is hardly good faith negotiations ,  and i dont care who is wrong .  .  .  .  if that is right then perhaps it is time as a world we considered preaching a totally different education to our children ? 
__label__0 hey people !  think !  are we looking at the whole story from the right perspective ?  or are we misled by perceptions ?  we automatically prefer trusting to a first world ,  first class switzerland rather than to a third world ,  dictatorial libya .  what if the swiss police actually over-reacted in geneva  ( there was a pregnant woman )  ?  why did the swiss not start an investigation when non-authorized pictures were taken in a police station and filtered to the media ?  maybe the libyans just applied the same “tolerance zero” method with the two swiss citizens who had some sort of problem with their visas .  maybe the swiss way of dealing with this problem was not the right way .  so people think it over again and understand that ,  as for now ,  you have only the swiss perspective ,  and i can tell you that it is just one perspective . 
__label__0 yet the eu and switzerland continues to do business with this madman .  i suppose no action will be taken until after the first terrorist bombing . 
__label__0 switzerland and the west have only themselves to blame for clowns like gaddafi .  since the early 20th century despots throughout the world have been supported in the name of "economic stability" .  switzerland has been a key contributor to and profited from many a brutal dictatorship simply through its existance as a safehaven for lotted funds .  instead of blaming gaddafi ,  how about looking in mirror once and a while ?  ! 
__label__1 the world should launch a towel embargo against libya ,  that way they won ' t have enough towels to wear on their head .  we are a peaceful people ,  so we would not declare a jihad against innocent people ,  may a mohammed jihad . 
__label__1 it seems this idiot started secret boozing not long time ago and that ' s why he started to talk more bullshit . 
__label__1 i us to live in gadaffi count in dem days he present him self wrong or right normal but now thru old age he loosing it . 
__label__0 2septimius: i ' m crying )  )  )  4 !  !  !  churches .  .  .  let ' s calculate mosques across the europe .  .  . or if you would like across switzerland  .  .  . so go and continue to pray
__label__0 what i personnaly think about for a quite long time looking on this religion situation ,  there is a disproportionality- muslims have their jihad and what should be done catholics ?  do they need to return holy inquisition ,  consider everybody who ' s not a catholic like an enemy of catholic church and burn into the fire ?  welcome to the middle ages ! 
__label__0 gutzwiller has started a great discussion .  how can we teach people to be responsible again ?  there has been much news about the problem of obesity increasing in switzerland .  everyone knows that the health risk is much higher and the potential of creating more cost very clear .  health insurance already take the risk into consideration like for example age .  how that could be implemented is obviously not as easy as proposed but i think it ' s a great start to find how we can keep people responsible for their own actions and decissions they make .  i am not sure if the bmi alone would be a good measurment .  also i hope we don ' t just stop with obesity but also start targeting groups like smokers ,  that don ' t just cause health problems for themselves but more so also people around them .  i hope this discussion will continue and some of the politicians will be bold enough to again put some responsibility back on the people and not just trying to please everybody . 
__label__0 the plain fact is gaddafi ' s son had done something which was illegal in the country he was staying .  prehaps he should have paid them more prior to beating them ,  and prior to them dropping the charges where he was then released by swiss police .  i also find it utterly shocking that the modern world - with clever human rights laws - don ' t collectively point at libya  ( gaddafi himself )  and point out the how ridiculous he  /  his country men appear to the world .  perhaps the fact many eu countries have vested oil interests skews their perception of the problem .  for me thats even more a travesty of the issue - business does trump all .  maybe one question is open ,  what has happened to these servants of gaddafi ' s son .  .  .   ?

__label__0 switzerland has a history of pointing the critical finger at other nations while neglecting to clean up their own country where racism is part of every day life .  the only way for them is to be more self critical and be reminded that they are not above god and thus not always right . 
__label__0 unfortunately rickenbacher represents exactly the negative image that the swiss have come to be known for over the last decade – one of arrogance ,  lack of self-reflection ,  and inability to accept responsibility for any imperfections .  his comment "what we are witnessing could just be envy" is the worst pr he could give .  the fact is many people around the world like the americans have no idea what the current economic situation in switzerland is .  they are therefore not capable of being envious of it .  what they do know about is associating switzerland with chocolate ,  cheese ,  yodeling ,  banking secrecy ,  and the holding of holocaust victims '  money .  perhaps it is time for rickenbacher to retire and let a younger generation of scholars who can think outside the box  ( does he even know that there is a "box" ?  )  and give us more nuanced ,  creative ,  and honest analysis .  presence swiss had done an admirable job in bringing to light the multiple positive cultural aspects of switzerland to several places around the globe .  their funding should be re-instated so they can continue to enlighten other cultures about the best that switzerland has to offer .  but the last ten years have shown us that all the propaganda and "branding" in the world doesn ' t make a difference if the bad image is earned .  presence swiss should stick to what they do best and arrogant policies and spokespeople should become obsolete relics of switzerland ' s past . 
__label__0 save from what or whom ?  stick to your guns ,  switzerland .  you ,  as a nation ,  don ' t owe anyone an explanation .  you have survived for over 700 years by following a path that you have chosen by your own accord . 
__label__0 the irony is that from the pension contributions made ,  the pension company already deducts a hefty amount as "management fees" .  so people pay upfront and then when these so called "professional experts" amazingly manage to lose money ,  they get the government to agree on cutting benefits  ( rather than retroactively taking away the fat bonuses and big pay checks handed out at the pension firms )  .  so the people pay fees for bad service .  time to look at this aspect rather than trying to skim off the normal man .  also ,  there is very bad  ( intransparent math (  being waived around to fool the masses into believing that the population is significantly aging .  what the article fails to mention is that when one dies prematurely ,  the pension money is not completely handed out to survivors but rather kept in the pension companies coffers . 
__label__0 martin cassar ,  it isn ' t just the construction of church steeples that are banned in the countries that you ' ve mentioned ,  but the building of new churches altogether .  even in "secular" ,  "modern" and "moderate" turkey ,  where i ' m temporarily living ,  the building of new churches or even repairing existing ones is something that depends on official permits that are ,  for all practical purposes ,  never given to non-muslims for that purpose .  moreover ,  on another side of the same case ,  the fact that turkish id cards have a field where one ' s religion is mentioned allows for open discrimination against non-mohammedans ,  especially when they look for work ,  just as though dhimmitude  ( the muslim system of giving such people a status of inferiority ,  of second-class human beings before the law )  had never ceased to exist in turkey since the breakup of the ottoman empire . 
__label__0 i think it is outrageous that the un want want to condemn switzerland for banning minarets .  switzerland is a true democracy ,  it allows it ' s people to make the decisions ,  the are not bullied into it ,  nor are they led by incompetent governments into a way of life that is clearly unpopular .  you just have to look at the uk to see how good it is here .  the muslims who come and integrate here are under no threat ,  those who don ' t integrate are the ones feeling uncomfortable and crying unfair .  surely it is the human right of the majority of swiss to say how they want their country to be .  most of us accept change with no qualms ,  however when we see what is happening in other countries when things are forced upon them and we get a choice as to whether these things are to be allowed here ,  then it is our right to say no .  maybe the un should spend more time in finding out what causes the west to dislike the islam so much and find a solution to that problem rather than condemning a country who has given it ' s people the right to choose for themselves .

__label__0 being the person of acute perception that ibrahim aldredi is ,  he has properly recognised that the ball is very much in switzerland ' s court .  which is why he is the libyan ambassador to the un ,  i guess .  anyway ,  libya knows full well what it has to do ,  and switzerland must not relinquish its position until all its demands have been met ,  including full compensation to the two swiss businessmen who were wilfully abused by libya ' s independent-from-justice ,  judicial system .  switzerland can well hold out until complete satisfaction is given ,  since even if libya claims that they have great interest from russian and chinese energy companies ,  libya gets to suffer the consequences of being a price taker ,  in a buyer ' s market ,  headed up by china and russia .  belligerent bluster is libya ' s forte .  economics is not . 
__label__1  '  ' it says that muslims in the netherlands are the victims of frequent minor acts of discrimination ,  including intimidation ,  brawls and abusive graffiti .

__label__0 99% of the world ' s top scientists agree that global warming is a fact .  they might quibble over effects and timescales but they do not disagree about it existing or about the source .  the 1% that do not agree have been proven ,  time and time again ,  to be in the pay of the very corporate powers that profit most from non regulated manufacturing .  the problem is that the masses of humanity have been so conditioned to let others think for themselves that they are simply incapable of examining an argument for its facts and simply seize upon the easiest ,  most entertaining explanation which coincidentally absolves them of any responsibility .  it is all moot at this point anyway ,  we have crossed the tipping point and it is all downhill from here .  the only hope of mitigating the effects lie in a tyrannical world leader who would make polluting a capital offense for corporations ,  ban the private use of automobiles and the rampant manufacture of plastic ,  etc .  .  but that won ' t happen .  ironically ,  a tyrant like that would create a holocaust the likes of which we have never seen but the holocaust that awaits us if we do nothing is far worse and will effect far more people .  good luck and good night .

__label__0  .  .  .  but one needs to pay attention to the fine print .  "many" issues are likely solved - however ,  the issue of germany sanctioning bank data theft - which the mr . schäuble also explicitly mentioned as a problem point in the press conference- might still very much threaten the whole treaty .  i personally actually believe the swiss parliament and  /  or the swiss population won ' t agree to the deal as long as their data and privacy can be stolen by germany - it is most probably a complete deal breaker ,  especially should a constitution change be required for the treaty to work .  it ' ll thus be really interesting to see under which circumstances germany might prohibit the practice ,  if at all .  perhaps they ' ll only give it up if they get automatic data exchange for german citizens and people working in germany .  we on the other hand might just grant such to them if we get germany ' s approval of us instating a way to monitor & cut this access if the political  /  economic climate indicates instability or the data is being abused for any non-taxation purpose .   ( just trying to picture how a compromise might look - this is pure speculation on my behalf )  .  either way ,  traditionally ,  our diplomats usually found a good solution for both sides to bridge our differences ,  at least every time when germany didn ' t insist on using its  ( very much existent )  advantage in strength to try strong arm politics .  so far ,  this did not happen - and that is a most encouraging sign to me . 
__label__0 as an american i love switzerland .  the country is beautiful ,  the air clean ,  the cities organized and neat .  the real threat to the swiss is not america but the eu who will do anything to force the swiss into the euro to help stabilize the currency .  the breakdown of secrecy is really about control of currency .  as rothschild said ,  "i care little for who runs governments ,  but who controls the currency" .  the half has not been told and the axe will still fall on the swiss if they don ' t fight for their sovereignty against all comers .

__label__0 why is mr .  or ms apollo insulting mr .  or ms .  s  ?  the svp welcomes foreigners who work ,  respect our swiss values and abide by the laws and rules of our country .  they only want to deport foreigners who obviously came here just to take advantage of the social security ,  and the well-managed economy and public services ,  and think that they can transpose a primitive .  disorderly ,  criminal and violent lifestyle over here ,  in the name of “human rights” .  it is quite obvious that mr .  or ms .  s is not part of that small number of unwelcome foreigners  !  as for the “political values and beliefs of all of those who fought for your rights to enable people like you to stay and become citizens of this country” that’s just leftist trumpet-blowing ,  a “more charitable-than- though” posture that ,  at best ,  serves to make those who proclaim it feel better than others ,  and at worst is calculated to capture votes .  so ,  mr  /  ms .  apollo ,  look inwards with a more self-critical eye ,  and review your attitude with a minimum of honesty  !

__label__0 i was amazed at the lack of attention given by pediatricians in switzerland to developmental milestones that would detect issues such as autism or other developmental problems .  my 1st son was born in the us and the pediatrician always checked key skills during his regular visits ,  but in switzerland it was just measure ,  weigh ,  give a shot ,  and out you go !  an opportunity to help children earlier is being missed . 
__label__0 my now seven year old was born in the us and developing normally .  just before the age of two we moved to switzerland .  by the age of 2 1 / 2 we were sure that something was not right anymore with my son .  speech regression .  being frustrated by anything ,  even banging his head on the wall at times .  the pediatrician in liestal told us ,  "don ' t worry ,  he will speak soon ,  you just have to spend more time with him ,  reading ,  singing ,  etc" ,  in other words blaming the parents .  as our pediatrician was not helping us looking into the developmental problems ,  we contacted the ukbb and also the kinder- und jugendpsychiatrischen dienste of our kanton .  within 2 months we had a diagnosis of autism .  had we just listened to our pediatrician our son would have never gotten any help .  after the diagnosis we asked the question: what help is available for our little one ?  sadly we found out that there was very little support available in terms of therapies .  the only true support we got was dr .  p .  mueller ,  a dan doctor who helped us with biomedical intervention as our child had lots of gastrointestinal problems and we learned about the link between that and autism .  in the end ,  due to the lack of resources and support ,  we had to give up a very comfortable and secure life in switzerland to move back to the united states where our son has blossomed in the last 4 years .  through health insurance he is getting 12 hours of therapies  ( speech and occupational )  each week .  in addition ,  his public school provides speech and ocuppational therapies during school hours for all the kids with autism .  he is in a mixed setting now where half the day he is in a small class with a teacher specialized in autism ,  the other half he spends in the general 1st grade with a general education teacher .  it truly is sad that switzerland which is a leading health care provider recognized word wide ,  does not have an adequate support system to help it ' s autistic children and adults .  my american friends kept asking me: and why are you moving from switzerland to the us ?  i hope for all the families who cannot just move to another country that switzerland will wake up and make autism and it ' s autistic citizens a priority .

__label__1 islam is very attractive to violent hateful social misfits .  it appeals to men who want power and control over women . it appeals to women who want to be controlled and dominated .  it appeals to the psychically marginal and confused who tend towards psychopathic violence .  islam legitimises the violent release that they crave .  islam is a total regulation of daily life ,  comprising prohibitions and commands ,  and it is also a complete explanation of the universe .  so it is easy to see the appeal to someone who cannot cope with the complexities of life and who seeks authorised control and hatred of others .  given the gradual degeneration and disintegration of western civilisation ,  islam has a bright future .

__label__0  .  .  .  .  and has anyone noticed any difference to life without libya ?  i think not .  it is perhaps time to think about a possible settlement for goldi and write off any discussions or interactions with the gadaffi bunch ?  he is the one who has been wronged in all this and regardless of the outcome of weak negotiations and the pathetic eu ,  he is going to complete his time .  .  . 
__label__0 having working in switzerland for 15 years i have noted the changes since my first arrival .  i actually do think switzerland has changed  ( although controlled slowly due to the political system )  .  people like pierre do exist in switzerland and as its their country he is entitled to his opinion for voting .  however all the writers are correct as growth comes from the external world of exports and competence must be increased to handle this growth from outside if not available .  but switzerland is doing it but maybe not fast enough and for business which is also usual in other countries .  the key reason pierre has his point of view is that not enough external politics and communication is available for the likes of pierre to consider just the internal myopic views . 
__label__0 this reduction in non-eu short term permits came without consultation or review and threatens the ability of swiss companies to compete for projects .  in some instances ,  key employees have not been able to renew their work permits because of this reduction ,  interrupting projects mid stream causing chaos and inefficiencies .  while some people may find it difficult to believe that there are not properly skilled professionals ,  it or otherwise ,  unemployed in switzerland ,  i ask ,  how can they be properly trained if the brightest minds in a particular field cannot get permits to come here and add to the training of specialists ?  surely individuals with a wide range of backgrounds are necessary to train new professionals .  this quota does more harm than good to the swiss economy and should be expanded immediately . 
__label__0 john lazby hit the nail on the head .  the swiss do not want foreigners .  unfortunately ,  the swiss suffer from several problems they don ' t want to admit: 1 )  they don ' t produce enough babies .  seems the old-fashioned role of women ensures that mothers feel overwhelmed and don ' t want many kids and the career women simply don ' t bother because of the social bias against women with kids .  therefore ,  the population is shrinking and aging fast .  if swiss men were not so patriarchal and swiss women not so stupid ,  maybe swiss women could contribute more to society ,  both professionally and in the baby department 2 )  most swiss don ' t bother with a uni degree so you have far too many trained specialist that are not a flexible workforce and you have far too many narrow minded folk who are simply interested in protecting life as it were-- not making a future for the country 3 )  the swiss elite are small and fighting a losing battle against the masses who have no vested interest in understanding the economy ,  switzerland ' s role globally or it ' s lack of innovation in social spheres of life  ( women ' s rights and advancement ,  immigration issues ,  etc )  .  long live the narrow-minded swiss .  .  .  .  .  at least they try .  but ,  if the educated swiss don ' t get this renegade bunch under control ,  they will run the entire country in the ground with their short-sightedness .

__label__0 if we ' re going to talk about "what ifs" then there are a lot of them relating to a different outcome in the spanish civil war ,  so that nothing at all is "quite obvious" .  defeat in spain would have meant that ,  by proxy ,  the ussr had defeated the italians and germans .  this would have given both countries pause in their plans to follow up with further wars .  it ' s possible that some or all of the invasions of 1939-1940 would not have happened in the event of a republican victory in the spanish civil war . 
__label__0 indeed ,  foreigners who refuse to integrate are of no value to the country ,  rather a burden i would say ,  and so we should do everything to "encourage" them to go elsewhere .  but those who are motivated to integrate should be actively encouraged and supported ,  with : 1 . appropriate classes - language lessons as well as lessons on swiss values ,  laws and customs - 2 . objectives to be attained during a set timeframe and 3 .  sanctions if the objectives are not attained .  integration of the women should get special attention ,  since they are the ones most likely to suffer from certain cultural practices that try to confine them to inferior status and to cloister them in the home . 
__label__0 we are all part of the same family ,  just at different stages of evolution .  while i would accept the lesser evil of killing a plant to be a necessity for human survival ,  we should nevertheless think in terms of the greater whole .  .  . the life .  .  . which runs through all things ,  with a sense of reverence and compassion .  these things should motivate us in our care of the various kingdoms of nature .

__label__0 it does make sense to teach humanitarian law to pmsc ' s ,  but at the same time ,  instead of just suggesting pmsc ' s follow a set of "guidelines" ,  would it not make more sense to make these regulations a set of requirements for pmsc ' s to continue to operate ?  and also ,  in order to make sure that pmsc ' s don ' t divert from these regulations ,  perhapes it would make sense for all pmsc ' s to be regulated by the un ?

__label__0 hi ,  we call english pommies .  we discovered this nick name originated as england was known as the apple isle .  today only a few  ' pomologists '  reamin .  recent research by prince charles shows there were over 2 , 000 varieties of apples in england .  he is passionatly seeking old apple varieties and propogating these .  commercialation and industrialization of foods appear to have made most species extinct .  mother nature with her profound wisdom supplies us a rich diversity of foods and medicine , lets restore this world to the paradise that was given humanity . 
__label__0 why is the following not mentioned anywhere in the article above ?  "the iranian proposal ,  which was conveyed to the bush administration secretly by the swiss ambassador in tehran in early may 2003 ,  provided a framework for wide-ranging negotiations with the united states ,  including an indication of iran ' s willingness to make peace with israel ,  end material support for armed actions by hezbollah and hamas ,  and allow intrusive inspections of its nuclear program as part of a broad agreement to normalize relations with the united states .  the proposal sought an end to u . s .  hostility toward iran and recognition of its legitimate political and security interests in the region . "  ( the usa not only rejected it but actually scolded the swiss for bringing it to them .  )  the usa is the aggressor in this drama ,  starting with the coup to overthrow their prime minister in 1953 and install the shah ,  followed by the us support of the shah ' s regime and the tyranny it inflicted .  the revolution in iran in the 70 ' s that put these religious extremists in power was a direct backlash against the american foreign policies in supporting the shah . 
__label__0 we too had an uzbek ,  a wounded afghan uzbek ,  who spent some ten months with us while undergoing medical treatment in switzerland ,  along with a number of other afghans wounded in the war against the soviet union .  he was later killed by such foreigners who had come to afghanistan to fight with bin laden .  as to the chinese uighurs and the algerian ,  i assume that they were in afghanistan and captured while on vacation or a bible study tour .  i also assume that the reason they were allowed to leave detention was because there was no solid proof that they had fought with and for bin laden ' s terrorists under taliban hospitality .  they were lucky to have been granted asylum in switzerland and if unable to adabt should be allowed to return to their homelands .  harry hayes and to merely mention that the 29 or so chinese civilians butchered with knives the other evening were carried out by the same islamist uighurs .

__label__0 hiding money in swiss banks is nothing other than a way to avoid paying taxes in the u . s .  period .  swiss banks know it as does everyone else .  the issue is whether swiss banks should be able to do business in the u . s .  with the express or at least tacit understanding that tax evasion is the primary purpose rich people in the u . s .  want to bank there .  if swiss banks want to do business in the u . s .  they need to follow u . s .  law or stay out of the u . s .  otherwise ,  it will become a company unaccountable by u . s .  law despite doing business in the u . s .  nobody says swiss banks can ' t do business in the u . s .  they simply can ' t do business in the u . s .  and without obeying local laws .

__label__0 ha ha ha .  .  .  . what a joke .  the swiss love to write about how great everything is here .  .  .  . everyday in the news ,  etc .  they really have a problem with admitting that switzerland is boring ,  cold ,  unfriendly people ,  expensive and non progressive .  once the banks give out all the info about clients ,  the country will finally empty out and the filthy farmers will be left .  that is the real swiss image .  .  .  . just crowded because the salaries are so high .

__label__0 i think many us cities have area qualify as unsafe .  a stroll at 2 am in any district of zurich ,  is really safe .  swiss people may be niave about dangerous people ,  because they do not encounter such social behavior at home .  is it a crime to be niave ?  the couple had applied for and thought they had clearance to be traveling where they were when they were kidnapped .  at the time of the kidnapping ,  were there travel restrictions concerning pakistan .  governments do inform there citizens when they can not assure there safety in a country .

__label__0 i am both swiss and canadian citizen .  born and raised in canada to swiss parents ,  and with lots of family still in switzerland i sometimes feel more swiss than canadian .  i am however in strong dissapproval of the confined bears in bern .  i realize this has been a longstanding tradition of the city and the bears are iconic to the capital ,  however in this day and age how can anyone justify keeping animals in confinement .  sure they have added a bit more space ,  trees and water for them but if you see this place you cannot help but feel this is no life for any animal .  i am sure one day in the not so near future this will change .  so who knows what my opinion will do here ,  but i hope that it may reach the eyes and minds of some of the swiss and make them think about this issue . 
__label__0 you should come to england ,  uk ,  where we have hundreds of married catholic priests - all former anglicans ,  who came across to rome over recent years  ( before the new ordinariate )  and were afforded a dispensation by the last and the present popes .  if it was not for these new priests ,  we would have been desperately short of priests here in the uk .  they have made a tremendous impact in parishes in particular ,  and their wives and children have been made most welcome . 
__label__0 well i for one am relieved about this decision and i hope the decision sticks for some years .  sunrise and orange have steadily eroded the market share fo the dominant swisscom and i believe that will continue .  a merger would certainly have reduced customer choice .  personally i choose not to use services from swisscom based on hearing so much negative feedback from friends and colleagues about their swisscom service experience .  i used to use sunrise but when their admin errors ,  incorrect billing and bull-ish attitude became too much to bear ,  i left and went to orange .  at orange i have found the technical ,  admin and support service to be very good .  if orange and sunrise had been allowed to merge .  .  .  what choice would that leave customers with ?  since the other  ' providers '   ( migros ,  lebara ,  coop ,  yallo etc )  are only piggyback operators buying airtime from the three infrastructure providers  ( swisscom ,  sunrise and orange )  anyway .  let ' s hope this well considered decision allows the competitions in the telecoms market to continue to prosper ,  which really will bring benefits for consumers . 
__label__0 @digit ,  switzerland: the answer to your statement is: switzerland must return to the old traditional neutral ,  and most of all totally independent policies ,  avoiding and departing the present alliances with the eu  ( schengen )  and the ineffective un .  in the future ,  the swiss citizens must do their homework and elect only competent government officials into the bundeshaus chambers .  switzerland needs skillful ,  qualified and responsible managers and leaders in government ,  not career seeking and mostly smiling politicians .  there is still some hope for switzerland to survive as a free and autonomous nation .

__label__0 i taught at leysin american school for just one year .  ( 1997-1998 )  i enjoyed many aspects of living in leysin and teaching at las .  however the one thing i did not agree with was the school ' s policy towards student drinking .  i lived in the senior male dorm and helped supervise young men from around the world .  teachers living in the male dorm were responsible to conduct breathalyzer tests on weekends when students returned from their night out on the town .  over the course of my year living and working at leysin we had boys exceed safe alcohol levels ,  several boys from our dorm came back with severe alcohol poisoning .  fellow dorm student did their best to treat severely drunk students by putting them in cold baths and pouring coffee into their systems .  i observed a code of silence in the senor male dorm among students and long time teacher supervisors .  the aspect of working at las that i hated most was the dreaded weekend duty and having to conduct alcohol testing on boys .  personally i think the school’s administration needs to make radical changes in its policy towards the use of alcohol at school by both students and staff . 
__label__0 wow . i know i found this article a couple yrs after the fact ,  but also as an alumn of this school ,  my heart is heavy to hear this sad news .  z from lebanon is correct ,  for those replying from the us or other countries ,  drinking ages are different over there .  we were allowed "drinking permission" if we were of age & it was approved by our parents .  we were breathalized as a standard of checking in at curfew .  the town & the people there are wonderful & that school holds the best memories of my life ,  as well as many dear friends whom i still have to this day .  it is always a sad day to hear when a fellow laser has been harmed or lost in any way . 
__label__0 funny ,  the radical party bites the hand which feeded them for a long time .  but i guess if they don ' t want to turn over all their seats to the svp ,  bdp and the new green-liberal party in the next national elections then they have to go that way ,  at least in the media .

__label__0 it ' s no wonder the swiss middle class is being squeezed .  think about some of the article ' s published in this forum and the response from readers .  outrage about cheap foreign strawberries and their impact on swiss farmers .  the financial impact aldi is having on migros '  profitability due to lower prices and the increased competition this brings .  protests against the construction of new housing because this infringes on idyllic swiss farmland .  opponents of foreign competition  ( big business )  in switzerland skilfully use patriotism ,  environmentalism and the desire to hold on to a dying way of life to promote their agenda at the expense of the middle class .  it appears the political left ,  which normally champions the working classes ,  are also drinking the koolaid . 
__label__0 tapirul: tobacco is a legal product .  therefore ,  your examples are totally irrelevant .  people do exchange legal products all the time in bars and restaurants ,  including drugs ,  but most bars and restaurants normally do not allow their establishments to be used as a marketplace .  sometimes they allow someone going around selling single roses or the blind who sell little keychains .  it ' s probably useless ,  since you seem not to be able to see beyond your own desires ,  but here is a real life example .  a town has 11 bars ,  2 allow smoking ,  one of those is owned by a smoker ,  who employs smokers  ( although does not discriminate against non-smokers )  .  he wants smokers as customers .  because you might want to go there ,  he must be non-smoking - just for you !  if you even actually went ,  and you decided his draft beer should be bud instead of coors ,  i suppose he would have to change that too ,  regardless of what the rest of his clientele likes .  too bad for them ,  it ' s all about tapirul and what he / she wants !  as it happens ,  a smoking ban was put in place and all 11 bars are struggling .  the market itself had evolved into 9 non-smoking bars and 2 smoking but ,  no ,  that ' s not good enough for the zealots  ( and drug companies and quangos )  .  now ,  for the fourth time: if every single bar was smoke-free voluntarily ,  i would have absolutely no quarrel with it .  i can ' t wait til you find out about the smokeasies and get jealous cause you want those places for yourself too !  !  !  i ' m working on a thesis analyzing the totalitarian mind ,  can i send you a questionnaire ?

__label__0 kendra you sound like a lonely ,  selfish old lady who really had nothing better to do but sit around and smoke .  actually you sound like an addict .  what about the exceptions ,  "catering outlets can set up staffed smoking rooms with ventilation and small locales of up to 80 square metres may remain open for smokers . " go and hang out there .  as an ex smoker living in ny - people  ( even i )  complained when they banned smoking ,  but made similar exceptions .  it works - stop trying to sound like it isn ' t harmful to the people around you when you smoke .  2nd hand and 3rd hand smoke are harmful - period .  you can talk and talk and talk .  .  .  . like we know you will and write your thesis bc i need something to line my bird cage with . 
__label__0 to allow a bad thing to exist only because another similar bad thing exists is beyond stupidity .  guys with your cooking / cars smoke argument .  .  .  they are bad ,  indeed ,  but they are  ( like it or not )  necessary for the society to exist .  it is choosing between two evils - select the lesser evil .  smoking ,  on the other hand ,  is not necessary for nothing ,  except the tobacco industry  ( nota bene ,  i am talking at societal level ,  not your personal individualistic one )  .  for the cooking and car smoke you can do other things  ( and they are done )  to limit them .  kendra ,  yes ,  you said it for five times ,  you can say it for seven times ,  you ' d be for the seventh time wrong and besides the topic .  whether or not a place is private or public has nothing to do with a legislation aimed at protecting the citizens  ( my example with the schools covers private schools as well )  .  being in your own private place does not entitle you to do whatever you like ,  based on "freedom of choice" .  try to have a party on your front yard with all people naked  ( you ' re an american ,  kendra ,  right ?  )  and tell me if it ' s possible .  why ,  you ' re on your own private property ,  and you are catering to your specialized group of friends who like to be naked and have sex on the front yard ,  who doesn’t like it is not invited ,  and if you the passerby don’t like it ,  turn your head .  this is why there are regulations in place for hygiene and for preventing food poisoning et cetera ,  despite the fact that the restaurant is a private business .  why can’t the restaurant owner put a note on the door “our food might be bad for you ,  we don’t regularly clean up our dishes” and let people choose ?  – no ,  it is regulated by law .  and it is very good that it is .  food poisoning happens in spite of these regulations because ,  as you said ,  the bacteria are invisible and it is more difficult to “see” them than to see the smoke of a cigarette .  it is a matter of placing the good of the community before the personal one .  so it doesn ' t matter if it ' s on a private property or not ,  it doesn ' t matter if i  ( the non-smoker )  have other places to go to .  pure and simple .  my health is above your pleasure .  and talking about other places to go ,  your estimate is plain wrong .  in a society that allows smoking in bars and restaurants you will never ever have 90% of the places choosing a non-smoking environment and only  ( for poor guys like you )  10% of smoking places .  quite the opposite .  if it is not enforced by law ,  it will never happen - this answers your claim ,  too ,  that you wouldn ' t quarrel if all places chose to go non-smoking .  we didn ' t wait until everybody stopped killing other people before declaring murder illegal .  i don’t know what you mean by “in addition to shs not being hazardous to health ,  it is also obvious” .  – i hope you don’t mean that second hand smoking is actually not hazardous to health . 
__label__0 sha-na-na said: "when people use "personal choice" as a shield ,  i say this - it is my choice ,  and a majority of people ' s choice ,  to not smoke .  therefore ,  i shouldn ' t be forced to inhale someone ' s second hand smoke because they choose to do harm to their bodies . " so go somewhere that doesn ' t allow smoking !  if someone wants to allow smoking in their establishment ,  what ' s the problem ,  people such as you are free not to patronize places that don ' t allow it ,  why force your demented ideas on others ?  i don ' t smoke ,  but i have no problem with others who do ,  and frankly ,  i prefer smokers to non-smokers ,  they are far less neurotic !

__label__0 los angeles former prosecutor roger gunson ,  the original prosecutor in roman polanski ' s case ,  his sealed witness testimony ,  reportedly contradicts the current los angeles district attorney steve cooley as far as the original sentence applicable in roman polanski ' s 1977 case .  the current district attorney was not involved in the initial los angeles prosecution against roman polanski in 1977 .  if the current los angeles district attorney steve cooley made false representations to swiss authorities in regards to the extradition request for roman polanski as far as the time left to serve ,  apart from the harm done to roman polanski ,  the california voters have a right to know this ,  since steve cooley is running in a california election as a candidate for california attorney general ,  thus it would be in the interests of justice in roman polanski’s case for the county of los angeles court peter espinoza on may 10th 2010 to unseal los angeles prosecutor roger gunson ' s testimony in roman polanski ' s case ,  and if this miracle were to occur ,  for the swiss authorities also to take los angeles prosecutor roger gunson’s testimony into consideration in los angeles’s extradition request for roman polanski ,  and not automatically assume the validity of the los angeles district attorney’s extradition request ,  and especially since there may be an ulterior motive behind his request ,  a pretext to extradite roman polanski .

__label__0 as a swiss-amrican who grew up in geneva in the 70 ' s i was impressed by the arabs who flooded the city in the summer months and behaved like nothing the koran ever described as appropriate standards for devout muslimes: drinking ,  smoking ,  hanging out in public with scantily dressed women etc .  .  these freedoms they enjoyed because they were away from the oppressive environment which was their homeland  ( saudi ,  mainly )  .  i find it now ridiculous that these "devout" muslims are raising issues with the fact that the free swiss society does not willingly accept their standards ,  as well as implement them into law . 
__label__0 a new clip on the internet warns european countries ,  and specifically belgium ,  of terror attacks if they pass a burka ban into law .  feel the love from the religion of peace . 
__label__0 perfect comment  ,  thanks : peterunited states i feel switzerland is doing the right thing .  when someone comes to switzerland they should adapt to the swiss way of doing things .  i visit switzerland frequently and do my best to the speak the native languages and respect the country ' s customs .  if the muslims don ' t like it i suggest they head back to the middle east or northern africa or where ever else they came from .  switzerland should stay switzerland .  no more accommodating foreigners no matter where they come from . 
__label__1 whilst i agree the burqua cultural and not islamic ,  i wouldn ' t like to see a legistlation about it .  many women do it out of conviction ,  and not at all forced onto them .  where women are forced to wear burqua ,  they will probably be forced to stay home as a result of such new legistlation .  these days it large sun glasses are trendy ,  in combination with a scarf and hood ,  you will end up some swiss  ( mend & women )  covering up most of their faces in public places .  .  . are you going to ban that as well ? 
__label__1 yes ,  ban the burka .  .  .  . at last switzerland is growing some balls .  it is high time that the swiss stop trying to accomodate all these different cultures .  if they want to live in switzerland then they must live and do as the swiss do ,  they can always leave and go back to the desert if they do not like it .  imagine if we were to live in their country and practice our religion and culture there .  .  .  . imagine what would happen if we were to take a trip to the desert dressed in a bikini .  .  .  .  . it would end with a public flogging and prison .  ban the burka ,  those who dont like it can get out .  this is switzerland and not arabia .  .  .  .  . oh yes and at the same time they can stop off in jerusalem on their way home and take their dome off the temple mount and go and install it in mecca . 
__label__1 the last line hits the nail on the head : raymond  /  cyprus a new clip on the internet warns european countries ,  and specifically belgium ,  of terror attacks if they pass a burka ban into law . feel the love from the religion of peace  ! 
__label__0 i cant help but question turning an article on a swiss in south africa running a hotel into a swipe at the minaret issue .  .  . 
__label__0 vera i like your comments & proper thinking about the world .  always enjoy your to-the-point opinions .  as far as "brussels" is concerned ,  let me just add this : all western politicians are so deeply corrupt  ( and also extremely incompetent )  that they completely "forgot" the citizens ,  who elected them into office .  all they care about ,  is the big stream of money  ( for doing nothing )  while making consistent noise & false impression on how good they are .  .  .  .  .  this creates a perfect opportunity for  ( mostly )  big business ,  which meets their "needs & financial expectations" .  the average & normal people are "invisible" to them ,  not to mention ,  that they will not bribe the politicians - simply because they don ' t have the money to do so .  notice that none of the crooks  ( from big banks or business )  have ever been punished for their crimes .  .  .  .  the reason for this "friendly" treatment : the politicians always benefit from it . 
__label__0 indeed ,  your ideas will not be accepted overnight because they are rubbish .  thank you for revealing that avenir suisse ,  despite a promising name ,  is sold out on promoting eu concepts of centralization .  providing services to all regions is common sense and does indeed contribute to a certain attractiveness as well as social stability .  it responds to the needs of the people and rightfully so and transport to remote regions is absolutely key .  "but may have harmful long-term consequences . " is intellectually very questionable .  harmful for whom ?  and what probability is needed to use  ' may '  ?  so we have something that is useful and good as well as cheap .  and this would need to be made more expensive so that people consume less .  why on earth consume less of something that is useful and good ?  so that people don ' t move out of the cities or so as not to serve the country side ?  "maggi assured swissinfo . ch that the population had not expanded so much that there was no room for them in the cities . " what city is dear maggi actually talking about ?  some national mean ?  each city individually ?  where does geneva come into his analysis ?  or are those people supposed to live in neighboring france with no transport at all and should all commute to work as well as paying the rip off toll from annecy ?  it ' s not only about the cost ,  there is none available .  that high speed trains posing all kinds of problems bypass switzerland is good news !  where is the problem ?  europe train system is not an example for switzerland and clearly should not be followed .  but i do agree fits in very well with avenir suisse argument of not serving all regions of switzerland .  the road too is too cheap ?  charge by the mile and let ' s install tolls ?  is this avenir suisse ?  installing a barrier on a fast lane ?  that europeans do it is no excuse for stupidity .  how much has avenir suisse been sold for ?  they are not going to get away with this ,  despite all the insistence and repetition and fear based arguments .  thank you swissinfo for reporting on this . 
__label__0 i think swinglish4ever & like-minded people should build a huge wall around switzerland to keep out anything european .  in swinglishland there would be no european agreements ,  schengen or other visas to europe and everything european  ( people ,  money ,  animals ,  plants ,  businesses ,  etc )  would be thrown out of the country ,  never to return .  i wonder what life would be like in swinglishland . 
__label__0 the relationship between europe and switzerland is far more complex than some seem to believe ,  and venting silly opinions and parochial anti-european bile is more a reflection of plain prejudice ,  and prejudice is always rooted in ignorance .  switzerland cannot wall itself off from europe ,  nore does it want to become a full-fleged member ,  really .  especially now .  but there are many interdependencies between the two entities .  swiss industry needs skilled labor that comes from europe  ( pharma and even watchmaking )  ,  for instance ,  plus everyone benefits from the n-s axes through the alps ,  etc .  .  .  there are crucial security issues ,  too ,  not to speak of ancient cultural connections that american ' s might find quaint and silly because of their own insularity ,  but which are genuiinely felt here .  i would also like to remind the person speaking of "euro-trash" that it is not dissimilar to using the n word . 
__label__0 the swiss have a great country .  don ' t let yourself be dragged into the eu .  the swiss should not be part of the euro-trash .

__label__1 just as it was outrageous for the catholic church ,  to put the untarnished reputation of its priesthood above children’s sufferings ,  so too those who put their faith in artists should realize that they too have no special claim to being beyond good and evil .  but as polanski never claimed this ,  he admitted his crime ,  and paid his dues and thus polanski wins ,  because he is not a hypocrite ,  and because he is by far – the lesser of two evils .  in fact polanski may not be evil at all .  polanski may even be really good .  however california & santa monica judges lose out here because they – in not being beyond evil ,  parallel the bishops in covering up sexual molestation cases ,  within their own rank & file .  california justices are not jumping to investigate santa monica judicial corruption in polanski’s case which should send up a big red flag .  bait and switch justice ,  illegal coercion in sentencing ,  is equivalent to raping criminal defendants & civil plaintiffs ,  all so the judges can receive a promotion .  when a sexual molestation victim in a police cover-up case faces police brutality in the judge’s santa monica courtroom using undocumented white sheriff deputies ,  to retaliate ,  intimidate and silence ,  so the santa monica judge can gain a promotion to become a california justice ,  this is also abuse of judicial power .  finally federal judges abuse their power also when they cover up for california judges and county of los angeles white sheriff deputy thugs ,  so the reputation of the men in black robes can remain untarnished ,  and so california’s sexual molesters ,  police cover up con-artists ,  plus california justice will also remain forever spotless in the eternal sunshine of the spotless mind . ”

__label__0 this article is going and went nowhere .  .  .  much about nothing .  the title started out as interesting but that is where it ended .  .  .  it should be said ,  that there was a transport system in place during apartheid  ( before  ' 94 )  .  the putco busses carried many commuters to and from work fairly effectively .  there was too a better than average public bus system and decent train system .  this was not about black and white ,  but rather the fact that since then there was no investment in infrastructure and these services were neglected .  commuters did not want to travel by the busses as there was a perception that they were legacy issues .  it is commonplace in south africa now for commuters to burn trains  ( if they come late )  ,  to burn busses  ( in the event of dissatisfation )  and generally destroy their infrastructure .  .  .  .  this gautrain will be no exception .  .  .  the world cup is not removing any of that but is more a total misallocation of funds .  it will not be profitable and the amounts of money being spent on projects which will have no benefit is astounding .  .  .  world cup is a smoke screen for mismanagement and embezzelment .  .  .  .  this poorly researched article touches on no real issues surrounding this .  .  . 
__label__0 i feel very threatened by the behaviour of a feew rich who try to steal everything from people in the name of bail out .  i am afraid my banker is stealing from my account and gambling in the casino and stock market .  my cleaning lady has a professional insurance ,  but my banker has excused himself of any kind of responsbility .  more scary ,  he is very irresponsible and still thinks he is right .  what should i do ? 
__label__0 well said bob !  every conversation with a swiss about crime leads eventually to some mention of eastern europeans: never any recognition of the swiss history of profiting greatly from shoring up some of the world ' s biggest criminals through the shady banking sector . 
__label__0 in a globalised ,  internet and email world ,  with easy access to developing countries outsourcing resources ,  switzerland is talking about minimum wages .  although it may seem to be a "good idea" ,  it is impractical and it will diminish the workers '  competitiveness .  paying a worker a minimum wage of 22chf per hour ,  and deriving low quality or "just basic" delivery of work quality ,  is the final nail in the self-endorsed closed-economy coffin of switzerland .  bravo ,  only the real "clever" politicians will endorse this . 
__label__0 and we should really listen to the uk ,  who has seen it ' s rights and laws and sovereignty eroded by being a member of the eu .  it costs it ' s taxpayers thousands of pounds and the british public do not like it .  it works for some businesses but not for others and is seriously detrimental to the home market .  the bilateral agreements work for switzerland ,  and should remain .  it also seems odd that the eu wants to bring in new rules to limit competition to it ' s member states ,  is that not anti-competitive ,  and against it ' s own philosophy . 
__label__0 i ' m not sure full membership of the eu has any benefits for europe or switzerland ,  but alignment is important .  it would be good to further reduce customs tariffs between switzerland and the eu though . 
__label__0 no surprises why the left part ,  i mean the western part of switzerland ,  doesnt feature in the top 25 .  the french speaking part of switzerland lovingly tries to replicate france in more ways than one .  and the results speak for themselves . 
__label__0 i was born in wetzikon ,  zh and lived in uster ,  zh as well as luzern .  kanton luzern & kanton zurich as well as their towns and villages provide some of the best quality of life ,  no wonder luzern ,  zug & zurich are in the top 5 ,  and i ' m pleased to see uster made it within top 10 .  while the french & italian part of ch are great too ,  quality is less as good . 
__label__0 it is not a question on wether switzerland wants to play nice and support the eu in respect to greeces finacial proplems or eventually even join the eu with a naive idea that we would be better off .  the question to the sicialists of switzerland really is: do you want to give up direct democracy ,  the freedom of having binding referendas a voting system that gives people not just a vote but a real voice ?  i for one feel proud everytime i am able to tick a box and have my say when i receive my voting papers in the mail - therefore i have to agree with stephen morris from australia ,  i know there are a lot of eu citizens who would love to join direct democratic switzerland !  and before we even think of bailing out countries like greece ,  portugal ,  spain ,  italy etc ,  we should be sure that their houses are in order .

__label__1  '  ' in this rather anti-semitic environment ,  it seems convent fahr was a safe haven .  '  '  it was not a  ' rather '  antisemitic environment .  switzerland was a virulently jew hating environment that had an official policy to stop jewish refugees entering the country ,  turning them away at the border to certain death .  providing a haven for jews was rare and illegal .  switzerland took over 60 years to pardon someone recently for doing so .  in addition ,  switzerland actively collaborated with the nazis converting stolen jewish gold and other assets into hard currency for the nazi war effort ,  as well as selling them weapons . 
__label__0 i as swiss have just to say ,  if the foreign people doesnt like our country ,  there are 110 more countries to go .  we wouldt change our policy and our laws .  thanks to the svp all of this would change for much better . 
__label__0 except for  ' swissinfo '  ,  the majority if not all of the established swiss and worldwide news agencies have  ' dropped '  this minaret issue a long time ago .  why is swissinfo continuing to inflame this subject ?  the swiss citizens and voters ,  by majority decided on and about this minaret initiative by democratic means .  a decision applauded by the majority if not all of the western world populace .  the people have spoken and the swissinfo experts must be  ' benched '  for good now .  i have to raise the serious question: do a handful of these experts count more than the majority of citizens in a real democracy and what is the agenda here ?  let these experts "mull" until hell freezes over ! 
__label__0 swissinfo does a good job of disseminating news in english as well as other languages ,  though i am sometimes concerned by the partiality and viewpoint of some of the reports .  i think a shakeup would do some good ,  though more in the attitudes and guidelines of some of the reporters than the funding structure . 
__label__0 my wife is a siss citizen .  i am american only .  i feel that swissinfo .  ch has helped me two ways ,  one way i can see where switzerland and the are very much alike except the us is alittle larger .  swiss info keeps my wife informed about her home land . 
__label__0 i have never been to switzerland but am a fan of swiss direct democracy .  i have learned a lot about switzerland through swissinfo ,  which i read regularly .  i would be happy to make a donation to help keep the site going .  i do think swissinfo has an elite bias ,  as most american press .  this has been most evident it the coverage of the minaret initiative ,  which has been overwhelming critical ,  despite being favored by a majority of swiss .  even though i did not like the minaret result ,  i would liked to see more of a balance of perspectives as they actually exist is swiss society . 
__label__0 i have to congratulate swissinfo for its unfailing ability to unearth all these no-nothing nobodies passing themselves off as experts and sociologists when all they amount to are politically correct timeservers and marxist yes men and cultural relativists helping swissinfo maintain the liberal left status quo as well as embarrass the profession of journalism with crude political propaganda like this . 
__label__0 i believe in religious freedom ,  but decry hypocrisy .  if we are ever to live in a peaceful world and respect the religious rights of all ,  then please implore muslim leaders in islamic countries to also support the rights of christians ,  jews ,  and other faiths in their own country .  persecution is not limited to anglo-governments and or cultures ,  but in fact is alive and well in all societies .  we need strong leaders standing up for tolerance and peace ,  in all countries .

__label__0 @ tariq ,  israel: the first part of your comment is so true ,  and i can ' t agree more .  as for the neighbours matter ,  mind you that before the establishment of that state in 1948 ,  muslims and jews were living in such an amazing harmony .  so was the case in syria ,  morocco ,  yemen ,  and everywhere .  you really want to know the influence of the education of hatred and racism ?  just pay a visit to one of the settlements and meet any child there and ask them about their opinion concerning their neighbour arabs .  there you will be able to see what  ' failed as a human being '  means .  shalom / salam to all . 
__label__0 @amr .  sir ,  if you read my comment again ,  you will see that i have clearly stated that the coin has 2 sides .  why did they not simply invite the israelis to come inspect the goods before going ?  this was provocation disguised as humanitarian aid - pure and simple .  frthermore  .  .  .  with turkeys backing in this ,  i am thinking that this could harm this nations credibility in her aspirations in becoming a member of the eu  ! 
__label__1 more israel bashing propaganda from swissinfo ,  verging as usual on antisemitism .  the way it jumps rapaciously into demonising the jewish state at the slightest opportunity ,  while at the same time supporting islamic terrorists is quite disgusting .

__label__0 this brief article is confusing and not complete .  does this only apply if one person is a ch resident or citizen  ( ie the ticket to stay in the country via marriage )  ?  what about if 2 romantic people from another country want to get married in the mountains .  does this law also apply to them ?  of course ,  possibly the refused people could try to go to las vegas to get married and then move back to ch ,  no ? 
__label__0 this is simple .  .  .  .  have you ever had sex with a swiss man ?  men in ch run the country and make the laws .  they would not get much sex if they had to rely on getting it from their stressed-out wives who have to look after children .  the swiss birth rate is very low . 
__label__0 good article giving real facts . some people in swiss find some schooling problems in teaching english for their children . otherwise good place they say . 
__label__0 it is utmost time to dismiss director alard du bois-reymond from his post .  his meaningless statements  ' and his counterproposal to take more preventative steps by working to integrate foreigners better into society '  sounds like he is living in some dream world or some vacation island in the pacific .  is there not sufficient evidence yet in switzerland that a large quota of immigrants cannot and will not ever integrate into swiss society and culture .  the remaing hard working ,  contributing and law abiding foreigners who did integrate without hesitation should not be worried or concerned about any  ' hard line '  steps to expel and deport all foreigners who have committed  ' any '  crime in switzerland .  what will it take for some swiss government officials to take switzerland back ?  further increase of violent acts or some future terror attacks at the swiss population by  ' foreign '  individuals ? 
__label__0 there are many "different" people living in switzerland .  26 cantons can not even agree on what is common and what is not ,  let alone what constitutes a "crime" by a foreigner .  the same laughing stock is about tax fraud and tax evasion in the banking sector .  as with experience ,  having an "automatic expulsion" law ,  many swiss authorities will abuse it to deport even the mildest "crime" committed by a non-swiss .  do you think i am exaggerating ?  if the rule is crystal clear ,  then i would say we are not in switzerland ,  land of the unclear and most ambiguity . 
__label__0 is there any movement aimed at reducing the number of foul cigarette butts many of these smokers thoughtlessly toss all around ?  perhaps they don ' t mind if i spit out my used chewing gum in their living rooms ?

__label__0 it would have been much less expensive and much less damaging had the ubs executives responded to mr .  bradley birkenfeld ' s emails in 2005 instead of ignoring and stonewalling him .  he demanded answers as to what was going on .  mr .  birkenfeld is the one person who came forward and exposed the illegal ubs scheme that was operated by former ubs manager martin liechti .  why isn ' t anybody in switzerland demanding that martin liechti and the other former ubs executives be held accountable for causing this entire mess ? 
__label__0 question - where is the seller going to stash this cash ?  do you think he / she is going to have it deposited to a ch bank account .  what about reporting this as income  ( ch income tax ,  as an article in the newspaper yesterday said the man spoke with a ch dialect )  .  also ,  do you think that the ch government may now buy cds with lichtenstein bank account information of ch hidden accounts ? 
__label__1 hi
__label__0 democratic governance ?  the free world should be doing everything it can to support the democracy movement in iran .  30 years after kicking the farmer out ,  many iranians have apparently had enough of the islamofacist swine as well .  instead of supporting corrupt dictatorships throughout the middle east ,  the west might consider encouraging the proliferation of islamic extremism .  while the short-term pain would be difficult ,  eventually ,  like the iranians ,  citizens of these countries will become fed up and demand the same freedoms we enjoy in the west . 
__label__0 roger federer has adjusted his game to suit the new era players such as nadal and davydenko .  hewitt belongs to the last decade and his style and pace is not up to that level ,  and hence federer was "dancing tango" with a lesser-paced player .  this is not meant to take any credits away from hewitt and he got really very lucky because the weather and differing level of pace ,  made federer lose patience and even motivation to get a win .  nevertheless ,  this is going to be an interesting wimbledon ,  because roger is ready ,  and so is nadal . 
__label__0 a country whose government gobbles up about 40% of its gdp in taxes  ( most of which ends up in the pockets of self-serving politicians ,  caudillos and bureaucrats )  ,  while offering sudanese-grade public services to its population certainly has to have its leaders living in a parallel universe when they try to get on the moral high ground vis-a-vis switzerland .

__label__0 the obama administration has shown it ' s total disregard of the us constitution .  the congressional majority have shown disdain for the will of the people .  so i guess the swiss parliament figured "why not ? " and how does ubs know who is a "suspected tax evader" when they are raking all us clients over the coals ?  how do they know who declared what ?  i guess the next thing is the swiss parliament will vote to force swiss lawyers to divulge confidential information on american clients .  if banking confidentiality  ( never mind "secrecy" )  was so sacred before and was tossed out by the parliament ,  is it such a big leap of faith to destroy attorney-client privilege ,  too ?  ?  ? 
__label__0 i wish the swiss all the success in the world cup .  before the game vs .  spain ,  i wore my 2006 swiss world cup t-shirt .  and their first game vs .  spain was a huge success .  i am happy for them .  go switzerland . 
__label__0 what will happen to the fund of other past and present nigerian rulers in swiss bank ?  are you still waiting for them to die before you probe the sources of their millions of dollars ?  it seems you are just after the fund of dead men ,  because if abacha is alive we will not hear any story of criminality .  funny
__label__0 kudos to swissinfo for shining light on this possibility .  as someone who is living in libya and sees many a citizen from libya and as expatriates being held hostage on everything from race ,  religion to sexual orientation ,  i find it encouraging that there are countries that can wield the stick against those who think they are above the law .  indeed it was the stick that changed "saddam" and the stick back in the 80s in the form of operation eldorado that impacted the libyan people .  when diplomacy and reasoning fail ,  what other option do you have left except to kick ? 
__label__1 god did not create on the beginning adam & steve , it was adam & eve . two men make not a family , and should not extend them all the regular family benefits as well the pensions . i would be glad to see the government spent some money to get does sick people medical help . there is no proof they are born screwed up . gays and lesbians have a modern day decease . which is at the moment goig untreated . 
__label__0 biju ,  you assume that all gay couples are male .  what about the female ones ?  would that be ok ?  also ,  if a child is placed with a straight couple he or she may also not be breastfed .  do you advocate not allowing couples to adopt children who will not breastfeed them ? 
__label__1 hmm ,  "a survey commissioned by gay groups found a majority of the population in support of gay adoption in switzerland . " and this is news ?  oh yes ,  i nearly forgot - to swissinfo it is . 
__label__0 i give the ref a red card , 
__label__0 i am afraid that the reffing in some of these games has been deplorable ,  in particular this game between switzerland and chile .  however ,  once this unfortunate event took place ,  switzerland did not play the same game they played against spain and i feel the final result is justified - even if we were 11 on the field .  this world cup has been severely marred by lily livered ,  cowardly and childish theatrical shamming  (  all teams guilty  )  and the referees have played right into this circus  .  .  .  .  a tragedy for football .  football has become a farce and i am left with an unpleasant sentiment about the game as a whole . 
__label__0 um ,  doesn ' t this happen pretty much everywhere ? 
__label__0 you guys are narrow minded and ill informed indeed .  it ' s easy to take shots at referees based on their nationalities .  saudi arabia hires the services of swiss referees in the national league  ( google it if you don ' t believe me )  and that ' s a testimony to the wise minds that run saudi sports .  it ' s your right to trash the referees ability and judgment as an official ,  but to act like ignorant kids and call him racist names or accuse him of playing politics ,  then you ' re just making the whole situation worse .  so lighten up and chill down .  it ' s just a damn game kids : )  maz saudi arabia
__label__0 well ,  after the draw with honduras i suppose this article is not worthy of a reply .  i will comment on the camel slur ,  that is ,  if a camel ' s trait is endurance ,  then the referee has indeed endured the swiss '  racism and stupidity .

__label__1 this is not even news except for the sentence of flogging .  once again singapore has proved itself to be a third world country that legalizes torture .  this is not 1994 .  barbaric beatings are not acceptable in todays world .  the entire ritual of whipping  ( caning )  is homoerotic whereby sadistic male guards are hired trained and paid to beat males after having them stripped naked and tying them up to a frame as one one tie an animal ,  and using a wooden whip soaked in chemicals to brutally beat them over and over and over again until injury and bleeding wounds occur while other salivating male guards along with a male doctor  ( i use the term loosely )  enjoy watching the entire spectacle until the victim is untied .  it is this inhumane cruelty that is making news .  welcome to the s / m world of 2010 and the shame of singapore . 
__label__0 switzerland has to be very carefull to how many can be naturalized swiss this can ' t get out of hand ,  the government has to be very carefull at this and the government has to ensure this by not hiring naturalized swiss to work for the public service in the department of foreign affairs aswell in the department of internal affairs this is a very delicate agency to which it has to be protected and if it is not ensured it ' s protection then switzerland will face what our forefathers fought for .  i believe this is not discrimination it is protecting our soverngty

__label__0 i have said it before and i say it again . federer is not the player that he was 2 years ago . this happens to everybody . you just cant beat old man time . not to recognise this and not bury your in sand . is not going to help anybody . all the greats retired around his age . he is the only player who does not have a regular trainer . training with luthi is a waste of time . please mr . federer retire grasefully , i would hate to see you losing to players that you would have thrashed a few years ago . you have done enough to ensure that you were the greatest player of all time . 
__label__0 now maybe they will take down that display wall in the zurich airport  ( waterfall hallway )  .  there is something grotesque and un-swiss in the adulation and hero-jock worship directed at the distant icon .  now he has to get old like the rest of us .  this is good .  his achievements will always speak for themselves . 
__label__0 slowly but surely ,  federer starts to become “irrelevant” on the tennis stage .  it ' s a difficult reality we the audience have started to accept - though reluctantly .  but the "actor" himself does not seem to realise it ' s best to leave when the ovation is loudest .  he has undoubtedly impressed us with his unique performance .  but he just has to admit the bitter truth that the world – including the tennis world - is a stage .  it might well be his time to exit .

__label__1 i have come to the conclusion that the majority of the swiss population that are asking for  ' high speed '  are using speed  ( speed  ( methamphetamine )  is a dangerous and unpredictable drug ,  sometimes lethal ,  representing the fastest growing drug abuse in switzerland ) 
__label__0 sorry paesc ,  but you ' ve got your facts wrong .  schweizerdeutsch is considered by lingusitic experts to be a language  ( not merely a dialect )  .  as you mentioned ,  it has its own grammer rules  ( especially the tenses )  this ,  along with other factors ,  makes it a language that broke off from german some 3-400 years ago .  the lack of a common spelling is due to the fact that standardized spelling is a relatively recent  ( 19th century )  phenomenon .  it was in the second half of the 19th century that the educated swiss switched to reading the german press ,  as there was an intellectual renaissance of sorts in germany .  so swiss society turned away from writing in swiss and to high german before standardized spelling had become a norm .  this is a linguistic delight of sorts ,  as each dialect can be recognized by its spelling .  within the swiss german language there are numerous dialects .

__label__1 the cia should now hunt down and kill this rapist . 
__label__1 my first impulse is revenge ,  to do this person severe bodily harm .  this may not be much of a consolation to most but the man is now pariah .  the whole world now knows who this monster is and what he has done .  he will never get respect again .  we hear all the posturing of the hollywood types but do they really represent the majority of people .  judging by this forum ,  with the exception of a few selfish and moronic individuals .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . no .  roman polanski will never live in peace again so console yourselves with that .  i also hope he dies hard .  bootz . 
__label__0 swiss government acted correctly - for a change ,  in fact polanski should have been sent back to france where he is a citizen and let them handle the case and all of this nonsense could have been avoided .  france does have an extradition treaty with us - date signed: april 23 ,  1996 entered into force: february 1 ,  2002 - citation tias 2179 unts 341 . 
__label__0 the us is a very different nation from what it was 30 years ago it is unlikely mr .  polanski could get any sort of fair trial here .  the courts legislate from the bench ,  legislators subpoena witnesses before committees to pass judgement .  the justice dept .  picks and chooses what it will or will not persue based ,  not on the us constitution but from political and idealogical grounds .  mr .  polanski is better off with the swiss ,  where democracy remains essentially as alexis de tocqueville exported it ,  so many year ago . 
__label__1 what do you expect from the swiss nazis .  they love people like him . 
__label__0 ha ha ha .  that ' s great .  finally a country with some sense .  thank you switzerland for making the right decision .  you americans are a joke . 
__label__0 i can ' t comment on the merits here ,  because i haven ' t read a bigger bunch of gobbledygook in quite some time .  whoever is writing press for the swiss needs to get a job at the white house and write teleprompter fodder .  it ' s genius . 
__label__1 where ' s all the outrage when you really need it ?  if you took your so called "outrage" over this one old pervert and directed at more pressing issues like the gradual usurpation of our democracy here at home ,  maybe we could become a better nation .  unfortunately ,  we spend inane amounts of energy on useless issues like the anus diddler polanksi ,  and other worthless & phoney celebrities .  if you want polanski ,  then protest his country of citizenship: france .  just google "french consulate" to see where the nearest one is to you .  ten to one ,  most of you who claimed to be so "outraged" will do nothing beyond this message board .  typical lazy american armchair quarterbacks .  all talk ,  no action .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .

__label__0 derek in switzerland for your information if california ' s county of los angeles judge had allowed the us doj to release retired los angeles prosecutor roger gunson ' s sealed testimony there would have been no extradition of roman polanski since the current los angeles prosecutors extradition request failed to meet switzerland ' s extradition treaty criteria ,  since roman polanski had already served his sentence 33 years ago .

__label__1 if he had been a catholic priest the vatican would have protected him
__label__0 so many "ifs" and "buts" and out of the most of the comments ,  this all out mentality of revenge  !  !  !  30 years have passed ,  laws have changed and so has public opinion .  besides ,  the us doj  ( whichever was responsible  )  screwed it up in the first place by not honouring the plea bargain .  and then they duffed the extradition procedure .  this in no way excuses polanski in any way .  you can only fault the system that allowed him to get away  !  !  now it is too late ,  let polanski live with this on his conscience till he passes . 
__label__0 congratulations ,  switzerland !  you just freed a pervert who raped a 13 year old girl 33 years ago and has been fleeing justice ever since !  !  ! 
__label__1 well that old fag will get what he deserves sooner or later . 
__label__0 surely our us attorney general will be filing suit .  .  . as soon as he finishes suing all 50 american states !  !  ! 
__label__0 you can have him .  swiss parents ,  keep your young daughters away from him . 
__label__1 it must be legal and acceptable in swissville for an adult to perform anal ,  oral and vaginal sex on a 13 year old . 
__label__1 just as the swiss collaborated with the nazis ,  now modern day swiss justice collaborates with child molesters as long as they have plenty of cash .  you have blood on your hands . 
__label__1 if the victim had been my daughter ,  he wouldn ' t need to come to the u . s .  i ' d go to switzerland and kill him there . 
__label__1 the age of consent in most countries is 12 .  the u . s .  has changed that by slinging it ' s money around in the form of foreign aid .  now that the girl is an adult ,  she doesn ' t want him prosecuted .  of course none of this matters to the "world policeman" and the country that has more people in jail than all the other countries combined .  good for roman p .  he creates good things with his films ,  unlike the u . s . a .  prosecuters who let psycho murderers off who are soldiers and policemen ,  but want to put a lifetime achiever behind bars . 
__label__0 the comments on this site are nauseating .  humanity is a lost cause - nothing more than vile ,  disgusting miscreants and deviants ,  and europe has become there cesspool of a bastion . 
__label__0 oh we understand alright .  we understand you swiss are gutless wonders .  we understand that you ' re protecting a child molesting piece of crap .  we understand that we need to stop spending money on swiss owned business .  we understand .   (  .  .  .  ) 
__label__1 payback is a bytch barry !  !  stop flapping your lips and destroying the country more .  oh and my swiss bank accounts will never be revealed to you . 
__label__1 the swiss ,  like the spineless french , have chosen to protect a serial pedophile .  this was done ,  in all likelihood , because of a back room deal with the obama administration .  this will keep his big money donors in follywood happy but will prove to be just another nail in the coffin of his reelection hopes .  this country is about to take a hard right turn and people in a position to do something about it will not soon forget this .  the misguided swiss ,  like others before them ,  will feel great pride in stepping on the tail of the lion - right up until tooth meets bone ! 
__label__0 i must be getting old .  .  . i remember when our heroes were the good guys and people who committed crimes against children were severely punished .  what a sad , upside-down world it ' s become .

__label__0 switzerland has long been a haven for dictators and criminals to hide their funds .  apparently it is now a haven for perverts and child rapists .

__label__1 "ron jeremy" ' s post was laughable .  it sounds like he simply hates his government and country .  perhaps he shoudl move ?  rather than sit and post moronic comments .  perhpas is he had a daughter that was raped his tune would change ?  thanks for giving the world obama ,  you idiot . 
__label__1 as a liberal democrat ,  and strong obama supporter .  i ' m all for child molestation ,  and the elimination of free speech  ( unless it agrees with me )  .  well ,  i ' m off to lunch with woody allen .  buh bye for now . 
__label__0 i condemn what polanski did many years ago but i am glad the swiss spat in the face of the arrogant american judicial system where judges have become a law unto themselves . 
__label__0 pathetic - this man is nothing more than a rapist and a criminal - who gives a flip about who he is ?  i care about what he did ,  and what he did is outrageous ! 
__label__0 it was ,  at the time ,  up to the girl ' s father to make sure justice was served .  while it is a quaint idea that justice can be obtained through judicial process ,  most of us know it is not likely to happen . 
__label__0 cash talks and polanski walks .  i wonder what it cost him to get out of this one .  what if he had raped a swiss girl ?  one wonders . 
__label__0 thanks a lot switzerland for this brilliant judicial decision .  outstanding .  i can say for certain i do not wish to ever spend any of my vacation money in your country .  what idiots . 
__label__0 he ' s a genius ?  ?  !  !  no one with that kind of character flaw is a genius .  the swiss are delusional in thinking that americans will understand this selfish legal move .  wait til the rest of the little american girls speak out .  he ' ll never be welcome here again . 
__label__0 keep up the good work
__label__0 the subject is polanski .  not boycotting the swiss .  not insulting americans who disagree with the swiss .  polanski raped  ( my his own admission )  a drugged 13 yr old girl .  think about that .  imagine it was your daughter .  do you think he ,  or anyone admitting this crime deserves punishment ?  it is this simple .  the victim believes polanski suffered enough and the courts should leave him alone .  had she believed polanski deserved harsher punishment ,  should the courts comply ?  of course not .  the victim and her mother brought the rape to the attention of the police .  they and the courts have the duty to investigate and seek punishment for crimes .  from that point forward the victim ' s opinion is irrelevent .  polanski may avoid prison .  however ,  he and his family will carry the shame of his crime . 
__label__0 the swiss were so right to release roman polanski !  !  !  arnold schwarzenegger ,  former governor of california could not pardon roman polanski ,  & said to the press that roman polanski should be treated like everyone else  ( which in california means treated to california injustice which is what roman polanski has faced since 1978 )  arnold ,  former governor of california ' s hypocrisy is now showing big time – not only did arnold lie to maria ,  to his own children ,  but also he lied to the people of california as well . 
__label__1 bp transocean were advised shortly after the rig sank in the caribbean ,  thus a while after the fire when little could be done due to safety issues for men ,  as they seemed to be incapable of holding the diesel nor how to restore a state of stability .  i cannot make this public as wikipedia has had my editing blocked ,  the bbc is fairly useless and political conservative ,  but i can tell the serious people interested in these issues .  my personal view is they could have reached this stage by about mid may .  but have been fooling about ,  that sends up oil prices .  this is a gas rig they should have been ready ,  bp is a gas driller with russia experience .  i know technology is complex ,  but i suggest bp is broken up and disposed of now ,  i tried to rescue it ,  the directors should be in prison ,  the government should seek sabotage as a reason .  we gave them an opportunity ,  i asked the president to give them time ,  i am no mechanic but i do know oil drill .  michael dennis stagg b . sc . wales hydrology soils geology u . c . w .  1969 m . sc .  senior lecturer 1978 as of this time the matter goes subjudice so we await the outcome once bp transocean have paid .  suits the bbc and cameron as this mucks up the whole economic situation . 
__label__0 i loved these clips .  i wish there were more .  my great grandfather was from corippo .  came to us at 17 to dairy .  cousins tried aus and new zealand .  i would love to know more .  if anyone is interested i would love to talk about it all . 
__label__0 @vera gottlieb: nope .  never worked for a bank or any other financial institution .  unfortunately . 
__label__0 switzerland should never kowtow to the the eu .  just wait and see ,  the eu will dis-integrate one day like yugoslavia .  when the people are forced together artificially they eventually force an opposite outcome .  switzerland should just stay out of this one ,  watch on the sidelines ,  reinforce and protect its borders and plan for better outcomes than being an obedient dog to the eu unelected and undemocratic masters . 
__label__0 excellent article  !  for those who regularly read the scientific literature published in specialized journals ,  there is no doubt that humans have a strong impact on water availability ,  biodiversity and earth climate .  it is disappointing to see that people do not see how climate change will affect them and wil affect others everywhere in the world .  scientists only report facts and try to explain what they observe .  scientists simply do the job they like to do .  scientits are simply interested in science . 
__label__0 simon  ,  nice article .  thanks !  i noticed in the sidebar  ( swiss mountain aid )  that “60 , 000 people live in high-alpine regions in switzerland ,  of whom around 7 , 500 work as farmers . ” these numbers make me wonder what are the other 52 , 500 people doing up there ?  maybe something interesting for another great swissinfo article ? 
__label__0 too many roadways ,  clearly .  while i don ' t think railways are significantly cheaper to build ,  roadways are more wasteful in terms of car maintenance ,  energy consumption per kg / passenger and kilometer ,  environmental impact ,  administrative costs .  and the efficiency of roadways is also lower for the current lack of control .  if a computer guides traffic like on the railways ,  you can achieve much higher throughput with no large cost .  but would the average car driver accept this ? 
__label__0 from what documentation i have read about anne frank ' s diary ,  it was not written by her but by a sister or cousin in honor of her .  according to this documentation ,  anne frank was already dead from typhus  ( or another disease )  by the time this work was actually written .  .  . 
__label__0 despite all our problems here in america , we ' re one of the last countries in the western world to maintain freedom of speech .  you can call the president of the u . s .  a son-of-a-bitch to his face ,  and so long as you ' re smiling and your empty hands are out in the open ,  the president can only smile back weakly and leave it at that .

__label__0 isn ' t this what neo-liberalism ideology is all about - profits before people and animals or anything else ?  ?  ? 
__label__0 the jump in the shareprice on the news of profits shows only 1 thing ,  the shareholders are "making use" of ubs as a moneymaking machine and partly responsible for the bad management of risky funds .  when the bank is good ,  they smile and profit ,  when the bank gets a little trouble ,  they turn around and say the bankers are devils .  see how fickle the public is ?  so next time ,  don ' t be so quick to label a bank or company as unethical ,  when the main objective is to make money ,  and lots of it .

__label__0 this news shows the high level of ignorance of the swiss and the italian governments .  in china ,  the death penalty is not a secret .  it is public knowledge ,  meant to deter the people from doing serious crime .  why should they keep it a secret .  also in china ,  there are no rules which prohibits the organs harvesting ,  and although this seems inhumane to many europeans ,  it is an accepted practise in china ,  where lives are saved .  therefore the chinese asylum seeker is really not providing some state secrets from china .  he may be prosecuted but certainly not for telling about the death penalty or the organ transplants .  what a joke !  he just wants to stay in ch . 
__label__0 while china is known for execution and torture of its citizens ,  i doubt credibility of chinese asylum seeker .  it is questionable why italian ' s issued him a schengen visa ,  and the individual traveling to oslo ,  norway prior in ending-up in switzerland .  perhaps he already applied for asylum in norway and was rejected .  switzerland should proceed with deporting the individual to italy and have them deal with his asylum request ,  since he entered eu via italy .  switzerland cannot be a safe haven for just about anyone .

__label__1 please do not follow the latest trend in the destruction of the english language by writing  ' expat '  with a hyphen .   ' ex '  does not mean  ' former '  in this case ,  but  ' outside '  as in the words exterior ,  external ,  and export .  an expatriate is simply a citizen of a country who lives outside the  ' patria '  .  do i need to ex-plain further ? 
__label__0 i have been on a waiting list for kidney transplant for a year now .  donating after death is a very humble and godly act and state govt should award such persons . 
__label__0 lisa ,  having lived here for 14 years now ,  everything you have said is so true and sadly will not change .  this is the 5th country i have lived in and the first where i still feel like a foreigner whereas i felt completely at home living in the others .  my husband is swiss but has worked abroad and realizes there is so much more out there .  all our swiss friends have either worked and lived abroad or live abroad with no intention of returning back .  hopefully a non-fatal solution will be found for these innocent bears who have no voice to defend themselves !  !  ! 
__label__0 why not release them into the wild ?  somewhere like the national park area in graubunden which seems fairly remote .  then i suppose knowing switzerland somebody would go out and shoot them within a few days because they would be perceived a danger to humans ,  or worse still just for sport .

__label__0 i think it ' s definitely ok to have 24h shops at gas stations ,  while they already have personal to sell gas .  groceries working till 11pm are also very welcome .  not working on sundays is strange .  why protecting sales people rights cannot be done by different means  ( for ex .  defining minimal payment or some benefits for sunday and night workers etc )  ?

__label__0 i find it a little one sided how the skepticism of the eu is also blamed on the fuelling by the right wing party .  there are many liberals who are also skeptical of the eu .  fear of joining the eu is not an issue which relies on emotions only or fear of liberalism .  joining the eu has some fundamental problems associated with it which are based on good reasoning and rational judgement .  dont blame the right wing for not joining the eu .  blame the eu ,  and the lack of real tangible benefits for joining .  bilateral agreements are signed for the very reason they are signed .  mutual benefit .  it benefits the eu and switzerland and therefore so far so good .  .  . 
__label__0 shame ,  shame ,  shame on switzerland .  i can ' t believe that this happens here .  and this is called civilized and environmentally friendly country .  i am even ashamed to talk about this to my folks back home .  shame !  !  !  ! 
__label__0 that ' s rich .  a company of mercenaries ,  who make millions from america for killing civilians without a declaration of war or any accountability whatsoever ,  relocates to ch to take advantage of the swiss tax situation .  apparently ,  being murderers employed by the u . s .  will guarantee them a complete waiver of any scrutiny from the american irs .  meanwhile ,  swiss citizens  ( lawyers and bankers ,  specifically )  who have never set foot on american soil are finding themselves under the ever watchful eye of america ' s tax bullies .  swiss neutrality is certainly at risk here in that these mercenaries are irrefutably engaged not only in armed conflicts ,  but in armed conflicts that are clearly illegal .  the u . s .  has not declared war on afghanistan .  rather ,  the u . s .  has stupidly "declared" war on a tactic .  ch had better immediately implement piece of legislation designed to banish america ' s mercenaries at once and permanently . 
__label__1 the ambush laid by the lebanese army for the idf ,  in which israeli lt col dov harari was killed along with three lebanese soldiers and one lebanese journalist ,  was a hezbollah operation .  although the maintenance work was fully coordinated with the u . n .  peacekeeping force in southern lebanon ,  and the fatal shot was fired by the nominally independent lebanese armed forces ,  hassan nasrallah ,  the head of hezbollah ,  sent a television crew to film the ambush .  he applauded the murder as a ‘heroic confrontation’ and threatened to ‘cut off the arm’ of lebanon ' s enemies ,  ostensibly by firing his iranian- and syrian-supplied arsenal of more than 42 , 000 rockets at israeli cities and towns .  it is hardly surprising that the ambush turns out to have been another staged performance from the jihadiwood production company .  the lebanese ‘village’ of adeissa ,  where the ambush took place ,  is not a functioning village at all but a hezbollah military stronghold ,  consisting merely of an elaborate system of bunkers and shooting platforms designed to look like houses . 
__label__0 the problems are interconneced  ?  surely the problem lies with the tyranical regimes in syria & iran which arm hizbuallah .  where is the swiss response to the lebanese attack  ?  had israel attacked lebanon surely ms .  calmey-rey would not stay quiet . 
__label__0 it makes perfect sense ,  it shows that switzerland is determined to deport the illegals .  giving money for free never achieved anything good .  this just habituates people to asking for more without doing any effort .  for those without imagination ,  a short story: http: /  / i . imgur . com / etfdw . jpg

__label__0 actually newsweek made an embarrassing mistake ,  calculating swiss points to finland and visa versa .  their "correction" after finnish press inquiry about calculations is even more embarrassing - they have now added finnish education points to 102  ( 100 is maximum )  ,  and reduced swiss of 2 points .  they claim "their calculations are complicated" .  switzerland is really no .  1  !  !  !  that is ,  if math is not on newsweek -level .  greetings from finland ! 
__label__0 @ gégène of no country of residence ?  !  europe ' s biggest street festival is the notting hill carnival .  check your facts before committing them to a public forum .  and austria consistently wins over switzerland for customer satisfaction surveys for europe ' s best skiing destination .  london has always been my dream city to live in for so many reasons .  i ' ve walked across zurich from one end to the next in 2 hours - why would anyone want to live there ? 
__label__0 to jack -having rented for 3 years in both st . gallen and zurich at the high end of the market i can say that the quality of property both long and short term is far superior here in london .  not only do we have the infrastructure ,  the city of london is the biggest financial institution in the world ,  but we have the best nightlife here along with enough museums ,  tourist hot spots ,  world class restaurants and theatres to last a lifetime .  if your idea of value is renting until being pensioned may i remind you that homeowners the world over will have paid off their property by this time and will have more exciting things to spend their money in their retirement on than rent - but each to their own- good luck ! 
__label__0 to torsrein ,  by value i mean ,  for the given amount of taxes one has to pay ,  the quality of life one gets in return is far superior than anything one finds in the uk .  whether many rent or not isn ' t really the point because in most cases the "good" you get from renting as compared to the opportunity cost of sinking capital into buying doesn ' t always come out in favour of buying .  the quality of rented housing even for a laborer is far superior than that of the uk .  these things are difficult to see until one has lived here for a period of time .  statistics doesn ' t always give the full picture just as someone else ' s idea of "best" isn ' t necessarily universal . 
__label__0 intresting and i hope it gies well for the swiss business people .  however ,  as we know ,  the germans have already played this card and the french as well .  therefore they are up against the eu and their politics .  sounds like an interesting opportunity that may be already too late ?  lets hope they can play in this arena . 
__label__0 the news missed out the fact that the prosecution also brought up the evidence that this swiss citizen had been convicted of spray-painting graffiti in switzerland a few years back .  indeed ,  this conviction did not deter him to repeat the stunt in a foreign country well-known for harsh punishments and zero tolerance for crimes .  the train depot is a highly sensitive restricted area ,  which he broke into .  that complements the sentencing . 
__label__0 how can the un be so sure of what is causing our climate to heat and cool ?  the wizards of smart can ' t even be sure if it will rain on friday .  the majority of our present day "climate science" is driven by political agenda .  wake up and follow the money . 
__label__0 how typical of those who seek to protect big ,  polluting businesses .  blame it on animals - something they have been doing since time immemorial .  it isn ' t animals ,  it is humans who must stop poisoning the environment or we ' ll go extinct !  and this means forever !  !  ! 
__label__0 the czar of all 16 us intelligence agencies ,  adm .  dennis blair ,  just last year reaffirmed the 2007 us national intelligence estimate that iran does not have nuclear weapons and is not pursuing them .  defense secretary robert gates backed up blair .  so did the un nuclear agency .  so exactly why is the swiss federal council tossing switzerland on the us / un / israeli "punish iran" bandwagon ?  what a load of hypocrisy it is that president doris leuthard recently told a room full of swiss youths not to let anyone tell them what to think ! 
__label__0 i ' m an american and i adore roger federer and his wife ,  mirka .  this is a nice article about roger and i think the author is correct ,  roger focused on his game first ,  sponsorship deals later .  he has done so much for the sport of tennis ,  is a classy gentleman and sportsman .  he ' s so handsome ,  gracious ,  composed and a great sense of humor .  i am so glad to enjoy his era .  great article !  we love roger in america ,  win or lose ,  yes ,  win or lose .  roger defines champion . 
__label__1 spoken like a true pathetic , spinless ,  german , vera .  hitler was right . 
__label__0 it is imperative that the swiss government continues its support for swiss living abroad .  many of us promote switzerland abroad ,  wherever it is that we may live .  having a say is equally important to us swiss expats and we welcome continued effort and support by the swiss government .  many of us left switzerland for various reasons such as career ,  education ,  etc .  and we are very proud to be swiss .  it is equally important that the many swiss consulates and embassies remain open ,  especially where there are large numbers of swiss expats . 
__label__0 of course the ruling class wants expats more involved - to dilute the voting of citizens at home .  it is no secret that citizen ' s abroad  ( ca )  are more liberal than their homegrown counterparts .  the ca were soo "embarassed" by the minaret vote ,  the poor dears .  but of course ca don ' t live in switzerland and don ' t have to deal with the realities on the ground .  it ' s all very nice to live abroad and have high minded idealist ,  utopian ideas about how things should be run back home so one can feel comfortable in the liberal salons of paris ,  london ,  and new york .  swiss at home are more conservative because among other reasons they have to deal with the consequences of wrongheaded short term policies .  so while swiss who happen to live abroad during an election should have a right to vote absentee ,  permanent ca with no intention of ever returning should hardly be courted politically and influence switzerland politics and policy when they and their children .  .  . will never have to live under those policies .

__label__0 yes maria ,  you might be right .  but i can ' t help but wonder about the attack .  switzerland has the system and no matter how unpalatable the proposal it should also be allowed to go through this system .  whether it failed now or failed later ,  or heck even passed .  .  .  this is the system .  there will not always be proposals that you like ,  or even can live with but that is the beauty of this system .  .  .  .  the people are allowed to speak .  simple as that .  that is something to be celebrated ,  and if i want to vote for anything i want i can use this ,  and the people will decide ,  whether you like it or not .  celebrate this .  don ' t criticise people for wanting to voice their opinion or having one .  nothing is perfect and yes it may have been abused but frankly there are alot bigger concerns in this world .  switzerland has not suffered as a result of this .  .  .  frankly i dont think many people care right now .  .  .  it happened and is gone ,  and heck .  .  .  if i want to i might bring it up myself one day ,  particularly if one of these crimes is committed against one of my family ,  and there is nothing you can do to stop it ,  except vote against it .  .  .  . 
__label__0 maria said  '  ' congratulations for making us swiss look like complete and utter idiots in front of the rest of the world !  '  '  .  please ,  just relax maria - the rest of the world has other problems to deal with .  hardly anybody cares about this initiative outside of switzerland ,  or even knew about it .  but of course people will make an issue about everything .  i mean it hasnt gone through ,  has it ?  switzerland and neither the world are going to end because of this failed initiative .  the same way that the world has continued to function and life is back to normal after the minaret vote .  of course we were told there as well that the world would change .  i am by the way also against the death penalty .  i like the swiss system and the  ' failure '  of this initiative just proves to those who despise it that no ,  not everything passes through it and just gets accepted . 
__label__0 tell the truth ,  marcel graf ,  you only withdrew because you had no political or financial support to carry on your farce !  what makes you think you can ignore our constitution and laws to satisfy your own little vendetta and try imposing your twisted perception on how violent offenders should be punished ?  do you think you ' re living in a banana republic ?  the way you ridiculed every swiss citizen ' s right to launch an initiative by proposing something dowright sickening not to mention illegal simply is preposterous and you should be brought to justice for it .  congratulations for making us swiss look like complete and utter idiots in front of the rest of the world !  next time you want to "air your grievance" do it like sensible people do ,  but don ' t ever again hijack a whole country ' s government and population to serve your own personal agenda !  it is at times like these that i am ashamed of my compatriots ! 
__label__0 hi ,  this article contains an incorrect statement "michel mayor ,  professor of astrophysics ,  and doctoral student didier queloz ,  observed the first planet outside our solar system" the first extra-solar planet was discovered in 1992 by aleksander wolszczan and dale frail: you can check this on wikipedia .  mayor and queloz were first to discover sth .  else ,  i . e .  the first planet around a main-sequence star .

__label__0 yes ,  the quaintness of the region will be diminished ,  but compared to any other swiss resort area ,  the beauty of the town shouldn ' t change much .  the building restrictions in place mean andermatt wont turn into the next zermatt and explode from a sleepy village into a glitzy sprawl of hotels and vacation homes as far as the eye can see .  the urseren valley will remain undeveloped and the amount of off-piste skiing in the area remains massive .  besides ,  the local population has been shrinking for years  ( all the young people are leaving for zurich ) ; this isn ' t for us to argue its merits ,  it ' s the residents of andermatt who are deciding their town ' s fate . 
__label__0 it precisely should be "i have 180 points ,  i want my bachelor ' s" .  not some professors random vision of what "should" be some person ' s education  ( often very biased towards this person ' s specialty )  ,  but the amount of hours spent learning subjects related to the field of profession .  and automatic recognition of these points and degrees at other universities would not "hurt" mobility ,  but enable it .  the problem is ,  bologna does not really ensure this .  universities can still require "dependencies" on their own courses for post-bachelor courses they give and such things ,  effectively enabling them to continue their all-too-often practiced tradition of hindering students when moving universities by not really accepting their accreditation from another university .  this has been an ongoing problem for a long while now ,  in no ways new to bologna - and it is not the only quite unfair practice that often affects students .  perhaps it shouldn ' t be as much the professors that run these institutions ,  just their own courses .

" churches are certainly not all about the sermon ,  they are communities of faith that act as witnesses to the gospel .  it ' s not a one-hour sunday thing ,  it ' s 24 / 7 .  switzerland is filled with believers ,  many who are not churchgoing .  it is a great idea to make services and other church activities more appealing to the young .  there is also a leadership vacuum on societal issues - we hear only from the catholic church on issues and it is time for the reform church to be more visible ,  to speak out and be christian witnesses on the moral issues of the day .  i wish this guy luck in that endeavor .

__label__0 drinking and driving in the us has less to do with when the people are allowed to drive vs .  drink and more to do with the fact that in the us ,  most people have to drive just about everywhere .  switzerland has much more extensive public transportation and new construction is usually placed as close to the town center as previous construction allows .  the results is that in ch ,  people have the option of walking home ,  in the us ,  they don ' t .

__label__0 its wise t remember that the swiss police can b quite different from police n other countrys ,  who tend t b more corrupt ,  somtimes evn criminals !  the swiss police are at least usually fair with swiss citizens .  .  .  suisse is a very special case ,  like a few other euro countrys where both citizens & police tend t be more responsibl & honest !  anyways ,  if u drive a car instead of use the very nice trains or swiss buses ,  u can xpect xtra costs like tickets that might not hav a good reason .  .  .  i ' ve seen police n the vaud standing ovr a mangled boy hit by a car ,  & this happens all the time all ovr ,  & so the police hav every reason t b especially vigilant when it comes t motorists ,  because driving a car is the most dangerous activity most all people threaten thr neighbors with !  driving a car isnt a crime ,  nor should it be ,  but it does happen t dangerously impact other people more than almost all crimes !

__label__0 does the increasing number of women in swiss politics result from the glass ceiling they experience in the private sector ?  is this a matter of the best and brightest moving to a medium where their upside potential is less restricted ?  as is usually the case ,  it appears helvetia ' s social evolution is a generation or two behind the world leaders in gender and race equality .  good to see ch is moving in the right direction though .  maybe someday the ' ll have the opportunity to run corporations or carry a rifle and rucksack like their brothers . 
__label__0 regarding the women majority in the cabinet ,  it doesn ' t say a thing ,  the situation of normal women day to day struggle with job fininding ,  career ,  kids ,  place in society is the indication and it is crap in switserland .  in terms of the new winners ,  i would have rather had someone from udc  ,  they need to deal with issues such as foreigners ,  refugees ,  social help ,  jobs and so on .  .  .

__label__0 i think switzerland is doing quite well as it is .  citizenship is something that is earned ,  not something that should be handed out as the poster below appears to suggest - that is quite typical of the eu actually .  not sure why people think that just because you pay tax you should be granted citizenship based on that alone .  i wouldnt take too much notice about what the arbeitsamt says either ,  the fiddling with gov employment stats is already bad enough .  next they will be telling us that the standard of living for the average person is rising too .  lol
__label__0 i was joking .  .  . 
__label__0 i blame all of that cheese ,  chocolate and gassy beer . 
__label__1 in the west bank and gaza 23 . 9% of men are obese and 42 . 5% of women .  the suffering and starvation there is obviously appalling . we had better deliver more aid quickly . 
__label__0 great pictures ,  the "ambiance" of the fight is really well described ,  with a real original point of view
__label__1 i would like to learn more about what gopes on at cern ,  i ' m fasicanated by the works of the project ,  it makes one think ,  and thinking is learning ,  just as the sun in our solar system could be a giant black hole  ,  or the inside of a giant black hole ,  if movement of masses of light ,  were to be drawn into a black hole who ' s to say that the energies that are created  ,  couldn ' t be prof of eletricty ,  it causes heat ,  lets say that w /  all that heat it couldn ' t produce enough energy to cause life , every living thing is made of carbon ,  carbon is found in astroides ,  maybe this theroy i have is nothing ,  maybe this theroy i have is so amazing it ' s probably of being real is just a chance ,  but if i were right ,  it could changew alot of views of this solar system ( 315 )  761-8880 ,  my cell # if my thoughts could possibly have some truth ,  please contact me because the worm hole begins there .  thank you again ,  james wilhelm
__label__0 i certainly hope the new female dominated cabinet moves a little close to the cause of gender equality and votes to increase the retirement age of woman to 65 ,  so that it is then at same age as for men . 
__label__0 let ' s not forget that swiss is majority owned by lufthansa .  any success for the airline is a success for germany alone .  the previous swiss management brought the company to catastrophe and near ruin . 
__label__0 yes and yes ,  we certainly do need more men and woman in parliament ( s )  like mr .  broenimann .  society is breaking down worldwide because of lack of morals and disciplines .  people like ab are walking the way to keep and / or implement as such .  be strong !  !  herr broenimann

__label__0 how does the statement like  ' we wish to have more swiss donors '  sound to you ?  for me it ' s quite comforting that probably here fewer people die in accidents in young age .  .  also  ' presumed consent '  sounds frightening ! 
__label__0 very soon ,  swiss army knife ,  swiss cheese ,  swiss watches ,  swiss chocolates -will have a new logo: "made in china"
__label__0 its probably the wolves scaring the animals off the cliffs .  wolves are not welcome , neither are bears .  .  .  . they are not friendly animals .  non rural residents should have no right to have a say on this issue . only people in postal code areas that are rural ,  should be intitled to have a valid say on this issue . 
__label__0 if only the nationwide ban was a real ban .  like in the uk where in every public place smoking is forbidden .  living in lenzburg ,  i am very dissapointed to have 4 bar / restaurants all with smoking aloud .  my favourite mexican restaurant smoking is allowed ,  god knows why !  i ' ve never set foot inside since .  the train station bar ,  the italian bar .  .  .  . smoking allowed .  a ban should be a ban instead of this joke .  working with many smokers ,  none of them have complained yet ,  but i guess when you see the chef ,  the watresses  ,  the bar staff ,  all smoking while working ,  then you realise that switzerland is still living in the dark ages :- ( 
__label__0 this article is heartbreaking .  i cannot imagine the difficulties of healing from such trauma .  thank goodness the international community has provided a place for all these ex-detainees to land ,  but indeed ,  switzerland would be a hard place to assimilate .  i wish these two brothers courage .

__label__0 difficult topic .  i agree that from the outside the death penalty in the us might look like a measure which does not visibly prevent high capital crime rates .  but if we look at singapore it seems it might be part of the solution of having almost no drug problem .  maybe it has to do with the society in which the death penalty is applied .  if you have nothing to lose it might not work as intended ,  generally spoken .

__label__0 shame on you the group of swizerland without an army .  have you not got anything better to do than protest ?  you seem to be informed just by the medias .  history seems to mean nothing to you ,  if it did ,  you would be at the airport do encourage a person who takes a stand ,  a person who does not just swimm with the flow .  remember ,  only dead fish swimm with the flow ,  hope you get it . 
__label__1 more blatantly slanted distortion and bigoted israel-bashing gutter journalism from swissinfo ,  which is not a news site but a vehicle of political propaganda .  now let ' s see if this comment gets posted .  after all ,  swissinfo welcomes  '  a variety of comments '  . 
__label__0 if the criminal is in the country  ( any country )  illegally .  .  . by all means: out ! 
__label__1 very sorry to see that a small country like switzerland ,  from whom one would expect sensitivity towards other small nations ,  should choose to introduce an acclaimed estonian conductor as "a former soviet star" .  honestly ,  it is as if one would refer to any swiss person as someone coming from the territory of habsburgs .  sad indeed .  hopefully not initiated by the suisse romande orchestra
__label__0 also hope they get the full ten years although disagree that any teacher should face justice .  these kids are old enough to be made solely responsible for what they did
__label__0 worried about duopoly ?  whatabout the supermarket powers - migros & coop ?  no competition missing here by any chance ? 
__label__0 increased traffic is being caused by people moving away from job centers to find affordable housing .  the solution is not to tax tranportation ,  but rather to create housing people can afford closer to job centers . 
__label__0 a cross was and is a torture device not a religious symbol
__label__0 if an extradition treaty exists then great ,  however many undesirables ,  particularly those from underdeveloped and / or corrupt countries will end up back in ch before the ink dries on their extradition papers .  what ' s worse ,  paying to keep them in swiss jails or paying to send them home only to have to return time and again to continue their criminal activity ? 
__label__0 zero tolerance to crime .  its a privilege to work and live in one of  ( if not the )  best countries in the world .  switzerland is not a country where crime is a forced survival strategy .  if legal and humanitarian deportation systems are created not only will half the crime problems be solved but also a necessary message of zero tolerance regarding crime be sent to everybody .  do not allow crime to get to a level where it becomes expensive and difficult to control .  deport foreign criminals and come down hard on local ones . 
__label__0 easy way to get rid of foreigners and gain their property at the same time .  since there are already enough laws to make everyone a criminal ,  simply choose who to observe until they break the law and then prosecute to receive the rewards .  since the brown person is deported and loses his property ,  he hasn ' t the means to successfully appeal his conviction . 
__label__0 exactly ,  islam preaches tolerance ,  yet it is one of the most intolerant religions / laws in existence .  stay home and do not infiltrate western cultures ,  period .  most of the civilized world does not want islam rule in their respective nations .  the nederlands ,  germany ,  the u . s .  etc .  finally ,  some european nations are speaking out against this ridiculous idea that islamic laws should prevail in foreign nations .  it is simply ridiculous to even entertain . 
__label__0 there is a deliberate policy by islam to erode and take over western culture one bit at a time .  we have to stop this erosion of our liberties and culture now , before it is too late .  either adapt to our culture or leave ! 
__label__0 religion ,  ethnicity or any other sociological excuse has no right to be over the law
__label__0 solution is simple: either remove scarf and play in switzerland or go back to iraq and play in iraqi basketball team .  .  .  if only they have one !  if one is adopting another country as their homeland ,  local rules should be obeyed and respected .  why can ' t muslims get it ? 
__label__0 whow !  !  this is public admission that money talks !  if you have enough money to pay the fine ,  it is ok if you do crime .  wonderful swiss laws ! 
__label__0 it became clear at the 2008 elections that the last administration paved the way for foreign banks to take over the us economy and reduce us to colonial status .  there is a third country in this picture that is not being mentioned .  .  .  a very rich one which was pulling a lot of strings to help create the mess ,  and now points fingers . 
__label__0 swiss banking has greatly been compromised .  well ,  at least you can sell watches to the chinese . 
__label__1 this new clown should be drowned in lac leman
__label__0 rene ,  the money thing applies to all countries .  e . g .  the case of americans who refused to co-operate with the mexican authorities who requested information on drug cartels who had deposited money in american banks .  every country will strive to do whatever it can to protect its own interests ,  and apply double standards in the process .  it is a fact of life ,  and politics . 
__label__0  .  .  .  . but i like it . 
__label__0 andermatt has been my home away from home when i visit switzerland each summer .  i ' m afraid that the new "development" will totally ruin the flavor of the village .  while i can appreciate the desire to make money ,  i mourn what i feel will be the loss of the jewel that is andermatt . 
__label__0 too many undesirables roaming the streets .  they are easily spotted by a trained eye . 
__label__0 i hope the efforts will be topped with success for the linguists ,  be these amateurs or professionals .  dear romands ,  germanswiss fear the extinction of their dialects by either the great number of non-swissgerman speakers coming in due to - again ,  see in the article - the economic boom ,  or the fact that in schools ,  kids have to speak standard german .  the latter is a total nonsense ,  and it is also being discussed in northern switzerland .  therefore ,  keep to traditions !  tsè à petrole à tous ! 
__label__0 some of switzerland ' s private banks have existed before america was formed and survived through tougher times ,  they will still be operating long after some great names turn to dust . 
__label__0 i think laruent gajo over-estimeates the so-called prestige arising from such international activities .  it ' s like suggesting that south korea will enjoy prestige from this weekend ' s g20 meeting .  that may be the case ,  but the world needs substance at this point in global relations .  all i see of the francophone summit from our house behind montreux is taxpayers money being wasted on military vip flights and overhead security .  like the olympics ,  i suspect this will cost the swiss people substantially more than whatever gains might be attributed to its hosting . 
__label__0 geneva .  .  . indeed switzerland .  .  .  welcomes the savage capitalists and gangsters .  what ' s new ? 
__label__1 switerlan switzerland has alot of dirty linens ,  they want the world to think they are the very best ,  but it is a very cruel land ,  live there and you will know ,  you will learn by experience . 
__label__1 jimmy connors has 109 titles ,  but you say 107
__label__0 i do not understand the opposition in europe to requiring all vehicles to have daytime running lights .  this legislation was introduced in canada many years ago and has been a positive change .  the daytime running lights are not for the purpose of lighting up the road for the driver they are there to make your vehicle easier to see by other drivers and pedestrians .  they are good for those times when people often don ' t have their regular headlights on ,  such as when the sun is up but low on the horizon or if there is fog or a brief thunderstorm during the day .  most drivers are smart enough to turn their headlights on in these circumstances ,  but some forget or don ' t think of it at all and the fact that the daytime running lights are always on makes it that much safer for the rest of us without infringing in any meaningful way on personal freedoms . 
__label__0 a very reasonable package ,  especially the idea to recertify elderly drivers  ( who ,  let ' s face it ,  pose a serious threat to the others )  .  however ,  the "via secura" is a part of the story .  what we desperately need is a "via rapida" or whatever the name would be: the speed limit of 120 km / h must be abandoned .  it would be great to have no limits whatsoever .  otherwise ,  something reasonable ,  like 140 km / h ,  should be introduced .  anyone feels like starting a volksinitiative ?  : ) 
__label__0 i think there are some major issues to sort out on the roads before bringing this in .  phone use while driving ,  police don ' t blink an eye ,  every 2nd person is on the phone .  driving so close on the motor way ,  i watch someone sit about 1 meter behind a police car ,  unreal !  driving 60kph in the town then 60kph out of town on an open road ,  people don ' t even overtake tractors here ,  and if you do overtake someone ,  they flash there lights like you are commiting the biggest crime .  .  .  . and indicators ,  what are they for lol !  they are also unbelievably impatient ,  if the car infront is pulling over or turning off the road ,  they drive so close and just miss the back of the car ,  just hold back let then turn off ,  you hardly have to slow down .  .  . driving standards are terrible .  putting headlights on all day won ' t solve anything . 
__label__0 havin been associated with switzerland one way or the other for a good 50 years ,  to me "swissness" is: the biggest democracy there is and never mind the propaganda bs of other countries . 
__label__0 i ' m really surprised that so many comments in the feedback of this article are so right wing .  are neoconservative politics really that strong in switzerland ?  "trickle-down" economics don ' t work ,  and have lead to the ruin of america .  it would be a shame to see the swiss adopt them also . 
__label__0 less government ?  that is when we ,  the average people ,  would really get stepped on by the rich .  local governments should not allow the rich to buy up a town and then ,  because of higher taxation ,  force the locals to seek living somewhere else .  only a certain percentage of condominiums allowed in hands of non-residents . 
__label__0 if people want to see what happens when big government is in control ,  just watch the eu over the next few years .  there will be protests ,  riots ,  less freedom ,  less democracy and higher taxes .  of course the politicians will blame everyone else except themselves .  sadly ,  the people of the eu  ( which is mostly left wing like barosso )  will get the government they deserve - i just feel sorry for the rest of them .  i hope people in ch will get a chance to see it before they become a part of it . 
__label__0 do any of these billionaires like football ?  st gallen fc urgently needs 5 million chf or they will have to close .  the superrich contribute just 1% of the annual swiss tax bill .  the other 99% comes from the poor people .  does this sound fair to you ?  perhaps the rich should pay all of the tax and allow the poor to have a better standard of living without tax . 
__label__0 so ,  switzerland comes 8th in the transparency corruption league ,  yet allows the superrich to avoid & evade taxes & hide their money in secret bank accounts .  i think i ' ll support the svp ' s campaign to kick out foreign criminals ,  except the superrich will never get caught . 
__label__0 which democratic body approved the transfer of details of bank transactions to us ?  democracy does not apply to hiding the riches of the rich . it means employees will have to leak more cds from our banks . 
__label__0 feminism is all about hatred against men .  it believes that injustice against men will automatically create justice and empowerment of all women .  the most dangerous aspect of feminism is their goebellian propaganda of false statistics even as 4 times more men compared to women die of murders ,  suicides and accidents every year across the world .  i am a men ' s rights activist in india .  i swear ,  feminism is just a communist ideology and it is bound to be finished .  the last thing feminism has to do is: gender equality . 
__label__0 i notice the feminists are being very quiet on this topic .  maybe they realise they have gone too far .  women want to be men = more lesbians .  men have been actively encouraged to reveal their feminine side so much that some have now got a boyfriend .  hint to the ladies - we want a woman to be a woman ,  not a man . 
__label__0 the trolls and crazies have arrived and aren ' t worth addressing .  but ,  mr .  andersson respectfully admits that he agrees with the rights i listed that feminists have attained in the past 150 years .  it is a big stretch to have an "antifeminist convention" when you support most of their measures ,  unless you are making a publicity stunt of sorts .  if you are a single issue organization ,  ie .  father ' s rights ,  then stand up for that and i will stand with you  ( as i already have in helping fathers to get custody ,  so i ' m not naive and it ' s not impossible in some countries )  .  as far as doubting "farzin jazayeri" goes ,  read some history books dude ,  there ' s no need to make up crap when historians have already documented it .  maybe someday somebody will deny that women in afghanistan were denied equal rights in their past .  name the leaders of women ' s rights in various countries and prove they hate or hated men .  you can ' t .  and what about the male feminists ? 
__label__0 the point of feminism is to give  ( more )  perks to women ,  and pretend that men were never oppressed by gender roles  ( even more then women ) 
__label__0 this is fantastic news .  it is long overdue that voices in opposition to marxist / feminism were given a platform to speak out .  after all ,  that is what democracy is about .  enjoy and rejoice that men are speaking out . 
__label__0 although i am swiss your tour looks to me a bit "crazy" .  sorry no better expression found .  i bet you have seen places i will never see but mountaineering is to me such a strange thing: )  born in basle you know the hills are not more than 900 m high and that ' s plenty for me .  but i must admit ,  you are really an adventure seeking man and i wish you all the luck you need for your sport .  no storms ,  not all that rain we have now !  and; if you meet people ,  just talk ,  most of us speak english now .  except the older in small mountain villages maybe .  i bet you would meet some new friends .  take care; mary
__label__0 just say "nein ! " to leaf-blowers !  what ' s wrong with a goat ?  ? 
__label__0 "islam is being equated with crime and terrorism ,  foreigners with turks and muslims .  islam is seen as a monolithic religion ,  a simplification that is as untrue for islam as for other religious groups . " since a lot of what amounts to crime in the west  ( when committed against infidels )  is not considered a crime under sharia law ,  which mohammedans deem "divine law" and ,  therefore ,  see as superior to western secular laws ,  associating islam with those aforementioned crimes is not unexpected at all ,  and it is certainly a reason why muslims are over-represented in crime statistics all across europe .  but most of the political class prefers to ignore this and keep burying their heads in the sand ,  because the reality and hard facts are just too alarming for them to acknowledge . 
__label__0 finally ,  the west is waking up .  i just hope it isn ' t too late and a case of shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted . 
__label__0 i wish they would implement this law in south africa .  swiss people should lead the way and not allow their non-violent society be thrown to wolves of crime .  go see how the nigerians ,  mozambicans and zimbabweans are turning south africa into a state of anarchy .  courts are backlogged and punishment don ' t fit the crime .  criminals are protected by the constitution while citizens are being slaughtered and massacred whilst the a . n . c .  government does very little .  my opinion is - if you want to commit a crime get ready to get your ass kicked out of switzerland .  no soft handed "slap on the wrist" tactics like those pirates who got such a light sentence by the netherlands courts .  stop sending out the message that crime pays . 
__label__1 no more corruption !  !  !  no more corruption !  !  !  !  good bye crimminals and darkness !  !  !  !  welcome prosperety sunshine !  !  !  !  !  !  ! 
__label__0 yeah ,  perhaps switzerland should look to their own central bank ,  the snb ,  for rising land prices ,  rising food prices .  then again ,  the gold backing of the swiss franc was removed by democracy - so there ' s no one you can really blame . 
__label__0 sure !  it ' s the little guy ' s fault ,  it ' s the speculator rising prices .  rising prices have nothing to do with the central bank ' s order of magnitude printing of money globally debasing currencies .   .  . it ' s the little guy ' s fault for starving people ,  sure . 
__label__0 a fascinating story of an invaluable resource .  i`d love to see the exhibition . 
__label__0  ' “why did the university allow such a debate between two evils ? ” ,  a member of the public complained .  '  though that individual might not necessarily be a geneva resident ,  with a recent article published by swissinfo on the out-of-control crime rates in the aforementioned canton in mind ,  it is more than clear that anyone asking such a question must be suffering from a chronic and hopeless case of stockholm syndrome and / or plainly an irrational follower of leftist dogma . 
__label__0 the whole thing was just the "usual circus" !  most us politicians are bought and paid for .  all they worry about and spend most of their time on is winning the next round of elections .  it seems that both sides are consumed with just beating "the other side" ,  not taking care of the country .  at the end of the day ,  the ones who really run the usa are the big banks ,  oil ,  auto ,  and other large industries -- ie ,  corporate top brass .  as an american ,  it really saddens me to say that i am lucky i have not lived / worked in the us for over a decade now i really do miss it ,  but that place has turned into one giant slave camp people work their lives away only to end up with nothing -- only some billionaires get more billions !  after working in the us for 20 years ,  i ended up ,  like millions of other americans ,  having my pension fund robbed by management .  as to the bail-out scam ,  how can you justify those banks getting about a trillion dollars from tax payers one year ,  and reward themselves $145 billion in bonuses just a few months later ?  ?  ?  ?  if the government had any interest in protecting the people / tax payers ,  it would have attached a simple repayment condition to the bailouts .  those subprime scams were designed by the mega brokerage houses  ( morgan stanley et al .  )  and all sorts of evidence were found to that effect ,  yet ,  not only those bankers were not punished ,  but they ended up with more billions in bonuses .  it is the multi-trillion dollar "savings and loans" robbery of the mid 1980 ' s all over again where thousands of of those semi-banks were also robbed by their own management and only a handfull of them got a "slap on the wrist" ,  and of course ,  the american people ,  again ,  got stuck with the bill !  !  at this point ,  the americans need either a revolution ,  or devine intervention . 
__label__0 how wonderful picture of swiss border adventure of john harlin  ,  i invite to the country of land of 8 highest mountain in the world
__label__0 would anyone at this joke called the un criticize the human-rights records of saudi arabia ,  libya ,  iran ,  cuba ,  china ,  pakistan ,  the sudan ,  syria ,  turkey ,  algeria ,  egypt ,  qatar ,  the uae ,  fatah ,  hamas ,  robert mugabe or north korea ?  of course not .  doing so is not part of the politically-correct narrative ,  as the informal ban on criticism of sharia at the un inhuman rights council shows ,  and therefore it will never happen unless the un starts over from scratch in order to do a real job of defending human rights across the world .  this is not to say that the us human-rights record is flawless ,  but there are way worse offenders that deserve criticism ,  but not a single negative word is or ever will be muttered about them .  this should make it more than clear to anyone that it is time for the un ' s dismantling ,  or for all truly democratic and human-rights supporting nations to quit it . 
__label__1 @ben .  i have not insulted you and i no apologies for someone who thinks that i ' m stupid .  i know what you are up to and you are putting a show and trying to put me under mental-submission ,  that makes me believe that you must be religious .  ben get real buddy and realize that i have no simpathy for people like you .  you are trying to portray yourselfe as a respectable person when you have proven to be the devil in disguize
__label__0 hasn ' t anyone told rlh , jr that we all have been called a black sheep at one time or another ?  in switzerland this has nothing to do with bigotry nor with racism . 
__label__0 "party president martin bäumle said the energy tax would double the price of oil and add sfr1  ( $1 . 04 )  to the price of petrol  ( currently around sfr1 . 50 a litre )  . " well ,  needless to say ,  i ,  and many others would simply start buying our fuel in the eu !  most swiss live close enough to make this a no-brainer . 
__label__0 the comment by beat lacks the objectivity that the writer criticizes on swissinfo .  this blank voting system can be a useful opinion poll .  there are enough left-wing oriented newspapers on the landscape that express freely their biased opinions .  i am not a fan but maybe beat would like them . 
__label__0 in contrast to beat ,  i think this is a good thing and will certainly give it a try for the benefit of doubt .  i conciously try to integrate and am frustrated that i cannot take part in such democracy .  i am hoping the site gives feedback on vote responses after the event so i can see whether any votes i cast were of value or not .  it will be interesting how similar the "auslander" views are compared to their fellow swiss citizens .  off to find out now .  .  . 
__label__0 switzerland has a bunch of laws to curb criminality .  however ,  the politicians gag the judges and practically the whole legal system .  the politicians for most past wear their hearts on their sleeves and feel sorry for these criminals who are ,  after all ,  only doing what robin hood did  .  .  .  .  stealing from the rich to give to the poor .  the only difference is ,  the "rich" in this case are not rich but hard working citizens who are sick and tired of having their quality of life tampered with because of lily-livered policies afforded to "guests" who would sooner stab you in the back than promote the good values and respect they seem to demand we give them .  this is simply a case of anti-crime .  if perpetrated by a foreigner ,  immediate deportation and black listed irrespective of their "situation" .  too bad if it has a negative fallout on family members or even if the perpetrator is from the eu  .  .  .  .  these individuals perpetrate their acts in full knowledge of their actions  !  !  !   .  .  .  in other words  .  .  .  intentionally ,  planned and often organised .  so ,  re-enforce the border controls and checks .  free movement of people did not include criminals  !  !  !  !  every one else is welcome .  however ,  i will say this ,  actingharsh on foreigners for these crimes must have equal measure for local criminals too  .  .  .  .  up the severity of sentences and reinforce law enforcement and crime control .  you cannot stop the rot only by targeting one group  .  .  .  local criminals should not benefit from equal rights either should they transgress the law .  i am sure the eu would not want our criminals active on their territory too  .  .  .  .  . 
__label__1 @max: no need to leave our country - we are already being squeezed out by the riff-raff criminals and mafia thugs from eastern europe and beyond that have come flooding in with the advent of schengen .  petty theft is rampant ,  and it is now starting to turn violent .  perhaps we should take a page from the us and construct an electrified ,  barb-wired fence around our borders . 
__label__0 as a foreigner living in switzerland ,  i find it completely reasonable that the swiss would wish to deport me if i had committed a serious or violent crime .  i am a visitor in this land and as such ,  should respect the laws or leave .  if you visit me at my home and smoke in my house ,  put your boots up on my table ,  insult my wife ,  etc .  then be sure that i will throw you out on your ear .  the svp initiative is as always ,  over the top ,  but i find the alternative measure acceptable . 
__label__0 @trixy: before you completely write off switzerland as the land of the selfish ,  please don ' t forget that switzerland has paid *billions* of francs in aid to eastern european countries ,  romania included ,  as part of the bilateral agreements with the eu .  and we the taxpayers are never quite sure where all this money goes given the corruption that is rampant in romania ,  bulgaria ,  etc . 
__label__0 an rene ,  switzerland : i like your comments !  keep up the good work  !  ! 
__label__0 as a foreigner living in switzerland i can only attest to what some have said before the sense of security that we had when we came here just a few years ago is gone .  i feel safer walking around kiev at night than i do in geneva .  automatic deportations or not ,  the real problems are the schengen agreement and the bi-lateral agreements with the eu .  you have at least two new eu members with the standards of living of the third world ,  just a bus trip away from zurich .  you have schengen countries whose consulates will issue a visa  ( now valid for switzerland as well !  )  to just anyone for eur1 , 000 in a nice crisp envelope .  how do you expect the swiss police to grapple with this influx of actual or potential criminals ?  and on top of that ,  if they do end up committing a crime and are somehow caught  ( which is unlikely )  ,  they may be better off staying in a swiss prison rather than going back to where they came from .  the real issue is the set of incentives created through policy blunders that stimulate endless import of crime .  i personally feel that reinstating border controls should be the number one priority for this country .  getting rid of criminals already in the country will be a lot easier with or without the automatic deportation ,  once you have actual control of your own territory and its borders . 
__label__0 i fully agree with the idea .  foreign criminals hav no place in switzerland .  i wish the uk would adopt a similar stance . 
__label__0 it ' s funny how the foreigners are conboluting and confusing reallety with pettyfull smiles with kind "liberal" voices showing of their culture thinking they will seduce our minds .  it is very funny because this law does not aim at targeting races it is clearly targeting people who have no respect for freedom and these foreigners and some lucky to be born in switzerland are trying to change the culture into a big drug party .  i ' m sorry people but i ' m not going to allow you people to deture the sacrifice of my forfathers .  all of yous who are not happay with this new law well too bad for you then because crimminals are no longer welcome in switzerland .  so i guess this is good bye at last to all you crimminals .  have fun doing crime elsewhere p . s .  a very proud actual blooded swiss
__label__0 @texswiss - seldom was a truer word spoken .  the hypocritical swiss would be the first country on their knees begging the us for help if they were invaded / attacked .  meanwhile the swiss just get on with bashing the us military policy because it ' s fashionable .  .  . 
__label__0 who needs an army when you have the us military and taxpayer to carry the burdon .  isn ' t it great when you can reduce the size of your defense forces to almost nothing ,  count on the americans to jump in when something goes wrong and whine about american military injustices throughout the planet all at the same time .  excuse me while i go have my cake and eat it too . 
__label__0 given that the un is funded by taxes ,  why does it locate itself in two of the most expensive places on earth - geneva and new york city ?  certainly overpaid diplomats can do without broadway shows and the powder at cran-montana if it means more people can be served by moving to cheaper locations . 
__label__0 the whole idea of back & future taxing undeclared assets of foreigners ,  and thence maintaining their anonymity fails to capture one thing: the source of such assets .  its one thing to hide money from your local country by keeping them here .  but the new negotitation deals fail to ascertain how the money was made ?  a dictator ,  corrupt politician ,  drug lord ,  etc is anyway making money at the expense of others .  so even with new reforms ,  he / she wont mind paying hefty taxes so long as their identity is not disclosed .  this maintains their status quo of exploitations anyway .  its just that they have to pay more for their haircuts .  which then means that these guys will pass this burden to their victims !  the game continues .  maybe this wil actually lead to larger exploitations in the darker worlds .  thus we are actually encouraging the black-money-generating activities ,  but convincing ourself that now everything has suddenly become fair and just !  how do we tackle this ?  anyone for a soul-searching exercise ? 
__label__1 by the way swissinfo ,  that video from 2007 about lumengo titled  ' black power '  the title of which seems quite racist to me ,  doesnt seem so smart now does it ? 
__label__0 @daniel so if anyone can do it ,  why make the racist comparison to mugabe ?  in your haste to look at him as just another black "mugabe" ,  you seem to have missed the point that he is guilty of fraud by filling in the sheets ,  not stuffing them into the ballot box . 
__label__0 if people don ' t want to work and spend money here they can always go back to their country of origin .  as they say here in bern - if you don ' t like the fondue eat the gschwellti ! 
__label__0 so if i live in zueri ,  am i considered a foreigner if i ' m originally from thurgau ? 
__label__0 prisons are for people who need to be away from society because they cause harm to society .  prisons are also punishments for criminals with hard crimes ,  and serve as a warning to others who may want to try the same crimes .  prisons are not hotels or holiday resorts .  they should be clean ,  and food available to the prisoners .  taking too much care of the prisoners may be a luxury and sends a wrong message to people .  prisoners ,  convicted criminals and normal people should be very clear ,  that going to prison is a punishment ,  a shame which is not an easy thing to accept .  therefore it is quite ludicrous to read ,  how "difficult" it is to run a prison .  human rights and human care is minimal ,  they should be kept that way . 
__label__0 itza - "anyone who tries to shed light to the current socio-economic problem that the world is facing mainly because of corrutp individuals who care less about their actions as long as they can stuff selfishly twinkies into their piglike mouth" .  most of the so called poor and suppressed middle class in switzerland are provided free education and enjoy a labor market that is one of the best on the planet .  the system is taking advantage of them to the extent that because they spend their lives living life high on the hog ,  eating and drinking out at restaurants ,  driving cars they can’t afford ,  going on fancy vacations and living in apartments / houses that are bigger then what they need ,  the poor manipulated masses are unable to continue their opulent lifestyle once the money stops coming in .  maybe if the so-called poor stopped selfishly stuffing their piglike mouths with the twinkies of a rich lifestyle ,  trying to act like they are something they aren’t because they are insecure about who they are and need to portray themselves as something better ,  they wouldn’t wake up at 50 and realize they have squandered their earnings trying to act rich instead of saving for old age when they really need the money . 
__label__0 it ' s incredible but true .  switzerland can overcome this by using liechtenstein as an example .  but the problem is where does the swiss government and the cantons prevent this from beeing abused by foreigners who naturalize themselves just because switzerland would to have a very comprehensive system in social and economic development plan .  switzerland would to have very strict rules as on to who can bennefit from such priviledge thus is getting out of poverty .  the elit will allways have increased income if they are the ones lending to their other patriots thus ofcourse strengthening the wealth and gdp of switzerland .  i believce that to avoid beeing in harms way is to not allow naturalized citizens this type of benefit because there is the risk of betrail of such individuals .  it ' s hard love but their chirldren if born in switzerland can be aligeble for such support programme .  switzerland does need to do a better job in strengthening entrepenuership
__label__0 but are they swiss biscuits ?  most of the corn comes from abroad ,  doesn ' t it ? 
__label__0 what the left wing doesn ' t seem to accept .  the "fairness" .  suppose that every day ,  ten men go out for beer and the bill for all ten comes to $100 .  if they paid their bill the way we pay our taxes ,  it would go something like this: the first four men  ( the poorest )  would pay nothing .  the fifth would pay $1 .  the sixth would pay $3 .  the seventh would pay $7 .  the eighth would pay $12 .  the ninth would pay $18 .  the tenth man  ( the richest )  would pay $59 .  so ,  that ' s what they decided to do .  the ten men drank in the bar every day and seemed quite happy with the arrangement ,  until one day ,  the owner threw them a curve .  "since you are all such good customers" ,  he said ,  "i ' m going to reduce the cost of your daily beer by $20" .  drinks for the ten now cost just $80 .  the group still wanted to pay their bill the way we pay our taxes so the first four men were unaffected .  they would still drink for free .  but what about the other six men - the paying customers ?  how could they divide the $20 windfall so that everyone would get his "fair share ? " they realized that $20 divided by six is $3 . 33 .  but if they subtracted that from everybody ' s share ,  then the fifth man and the sixth man would each end up being paid to drink his beer .  so ,  the bar owner suggested that it would be fair to reduce each man ' s bill by roughly the same amount ,  and he proceeded to work out the amounts each should pay .  and so: the fifth man ,  like the first four ,  now paid nothing  ( 100% savings )  .  the sixth now paid $2 instead of $3  ( 33%savings )  .  the seventh now pay $5 instead of $7  ( 28%savings )  .  the eighth now paid $9 instead of $12  ( 25% savings )  .  the ninth now paid $14 instead of $18  ( 22% savings )  .  the tenth now paid $49 instead of $59  ( 16% savings )  .  each of the six was better off than before .  and the first four continued to drink for free .  but once outside the restaurant ,  the men began to compare their savings .  "i only got a dollar out of the $20 , " declared the sixth man .  he pointed to the tenth man ,  "but he got $10 ! " "yeah ,  that ' s right , " exclaimed the fifth man .  "i only saved a dollar ,  too .  it ' s unfair that he got ten times more than i ! " "that ' s true !  ! " shouted the seventh man .  "why should he get $10 back when i got only two ?  the wealthy get all the breaks ! " "wait a minute , " yelled the first four men in unison .  "we didn ' t get anything at all .  the system exploits the poor ! " the nine men surrounded the tenth and beat him up .  the next night the tenth man didn ' t show up for drinks ,  so the nine sat down and had beers without him .  but when it came time to pay the bill ,  they discovered something important .  they didn ' t have enough money between all of them for even half of the bill ! 
__label__0 vera do you actually have evidence of this blanket statement that your making ?  please tell me which  ' rich '   ( rich or elites ,  big difference )  dont pay their  ' fair '  share of tax .  who are they ?  is it mr and mrs gunther who have worked like dogs all their lives and own their own house bought 50 years ago that is worth 1 . 5million today ,  but hardly have an income ?  are they these so called  ' rich '  ?  what you think is  ' fair '  share to pay is probably 80% of the  ' rich ' s '  income .  people should stop being jealous and instead go get a job and work hard and ask the government to instead lower everyones taxes instead of increasing them - that would be fair .  stupid people always think that a lack of taxes is the problem .  the reason europe is collapsing is because politicians are taxing the ordinary people to death .  make it fair by everyone paying lower taxes .  this stops the government bribing the majority at the expense of others .  lower taxes is what encourages people to go to work every morning ,  and thats whether your rich or poor .  nobody goes to work just because he feels better about himself that his neighbour is paying higher taxes ,  everyone should look at their own situation and get the government to start lowering taxes there .  high taxes make the middle class and poor lazy  ( whats the incentive !  !  )  and the rich to go somewhere else or to hide their assets .  by punishing the politicians with excessive spending and lowering everyones taxes we can stop creating this jealousy and envy within our society that is the cancer of socialists .  those who want switzerland to become like the rest of europe ,  a bunch of over taxed ,  bailout loving ,  basketcase economies ,  i guess should vote for this initiative . 
__label__0 i ' ve noticed that many foreigners have integrated very well with those from other countries but not with the swiss .  is this the foreigners fault ?  however ,  to all foreigners living here ,  you are here to work ,  not to receive handouts .  i ' ve been here nearly 15 years & not once have i received monetary help . 
__label__0 @emma .  that ' s the type of thinking that is being imported to switzerland .  no comment . 
__label__0 yes , he is 32 and he is still spraying trains , while you are slleping at home , waiting to wake up at seven , working till 5 . yes , he should really get a life , a real robot-life like you . he does the things , you see in movies and at least proves that he´s alive and got balls . 
__label__0 so spraying graffiti equates to living it up .  .  .  that ' s new .  so i guess with that logic ,  inner cities with all that graffiti and ghettos + hoods are places that are the mecca to self-expression and happiness derived from self-expression ?  wonder why people want to move to orderly rhode island or manhatten instead ?  and i didn ' t know being productive to the society is a lesser deed than being a vandal .  last i check ,  for every vandalism done ,  tax payers '  money are used to clean up the mess .  .  .  sad to know that the defn of balls and being alive is equated to being a pest to the society .  .  .

__label__0 @nitesh i really cannot understand your claim of racial discrimination in granting visas for qualified non-eu immigrants switzerland has many such professionals in the engineering ,  chemical and health industries .  if you can convince a company of your qualifications and experience they will apply for your work permit ,  if cantonal quotas permit it will be granted irrespective of your origins .  i was a foreign software engineer recruited in the mid 1970s when an influx of it staff arrived from all over the world due to the lack of a swiss formal education in our discipline at that time and the urgent need of industry to meet technical requirements in world markets .  i have to say that all of us ,  as well-qualified professionals including many non-europeans  ( many from india )  ,  were all treated with respect and their partners also were able to secure work permits and swiss jobs .  most of my contemporaries integrated well including the non-europeans ,  learning the language and achieving senior positions within swiss industry . 
__label__0 yeah .  . yeah ,  same old story .  we need to bring in more talent from far away places .  at our cost of course .  it ' s our business !  switzerland is first of all not considered any it power and most likely never will be as the history in the  ' high-tech '  swiss semiconductor industry has proven .  where is it ?  why don ' t the swiss industry leaders return to basics and look back what made the country once a world power house in several industries . 
__label__0 maybe it would help if it specialists were not per se given as bosses the guys who were not capable of doing the work ,  or being told they are "unable to communicate" when they are faced with highly complex problems and have to concentrate on their tasks to succeed .  i think the problem is less that we have too few it resources than that those people have who are really competent just don ' t accept to do this job under the current conditions .  these guys move on and do something else where they can make a career of their competence .  i believe that to keep working it talents the industry should face the fact that classical "hierarchical" models are not compatible with every it field .  and there are other models out there that solve these issues .

__label__0 imprisonment servers many purposes .  deterrence is only one ,  and i suspect that these hoodlums weren ' t weighing up sentence duration when they committed their crimes .  prison sentences almost certainly increases the risk of re-offending ,  but the victims have a right to seek retribution .  these thugs will be walking the streets when their victims have many more years of financial hardship ,  disability and dislocation to come .  where is the justice for them ? 
__label__0 quite possibly ,  at age 14 or 15 the grandfathers and great-grandfathers of these youths were already working in the fields or factory to help support their families .  still today ,  in less privileged countries ,  young people of that age ,  and even younger ,  have to work either after school or instead of school .  in many societies and traditions ,  the “coming of age” when a child is considered to have acquired a mature personality  ( i . e .  proper socialization and common-sense )  and therefore to be treated as an adult ,  is 12 .  while it is a welcome improvement that nowadays young people can concentrate on learning and getting professional skills ,  i really wonder why our authorities insist on treating teen-aged offenders ,  who at 14 are already strong enough to inflict severe damage ,  as “children” .  by that age ,  although they have no diplomas or professional qualifications yet ,  they are certainly old enough to know how to behave .  if not ,  there is something severely wrong with our educational system .  the legal coddling that these young offenders receive only reinforces their belief that at their age everything is permitted - so let’s do it all before we become legally “adult”  ! 
__label__0 switzerland ' s army is more important than a lot of swiss seem to realize .  in spite of these peaceable times in europe ,  wars start a lot quicker than a country can raise and train an army .  also the defense of one ' s country is the responsibility of all not just a few volunteers .  switzerland don ' t sell your army short .  read your history .

__label__0 do the math ,  300chf per person for a family of four or five is a lot for the working poor ,  among whom immigrants and the second generation are over-represented .  but it cost my friend 650chf per person ,  making that out of the reach of many families with multiple members .  and the community might vote against your citizenship ,  especially if your name isn ' t tom .  ra is right ,  it shouldn ' t matter where your grandmother came from when it comes to the justice system ,  that is racism .

__label__1 dede gecaj was killed in the prison by the switzerland racist state .  switzerland state and media are trying to twist and cover the crime they did but the truth will see the light .  the pedophile teacher ,  the brother of top high-ranking policeman in st gallen  ( this fact is never mentioned in newspapers or tv )  had raped and killed besarta ,  the 14-year old ded gecaj ' s daughter .  most probably the state had killed besarta ,  his daughter  ( who should be 25 years by now )  after unlawfully isolating her from her family for 11 years !  this crime can´t be hidden and the indictment against switzerland should be taken place in european court .  this is a monstrous crime by the state that claims to be civilized .  switzerland with its people in st .  gallen prison poisoned ,  gased and killed dede gecaj .  it ' s a state and media crime ,  murderous act that will be uncovered sooner or later .

__label__0 @francis patrick .  lol .  for those  ( if any )  who did not get your joke: romanch is just short of proposing latin ,  ancient greek or aramaic .  the native language is an ancient idiom spoken by the founding members  ( in the center )  of switzerland .  nowadays ,  only talented linguists could understand it .  seems to remotely related to dutch ,  english ,  middle german ,  and evolved into modern swiss germanic dialects over the past seven centuries . 
__label__0 yes ,  i agree switzerland should have only one official language ,  but which one .  well if you choose german that will anger the french and italian .  if you choose italian that will anger the german and french .  and if you choose french that will anger the german and italian .  but if you choose romansh that will anger everybody !  also which language is native to switzerland ?  not german or italian or french but romansh .  so the cantons should continue to conduct the schools in the native dialect but when it comes to a second language make it romansh .  so that when swiss have to communicate with each other they will have a common language .  don ' t adapt english ,  you ' ll lose your culture .

__label__0 one of the best & most meaningful articles i have ever read on the swissinfo website .  it seems many miss the point .  it is not about if you shop one day or the next ,  instead .  it is about becoming conscious about your consuming behavior .  even one’s experience for a day ,  can cause a reevaluation of the conditioning so deeply integrated into our society ,  and consciousness .  bravo to this awareness offering proposition ! 
__label__0 i find the arguments used to impose consumption free days very dubious .  there is a mix of religious and secular opinions on the matter while i ' m being totally in favor of being as environmental friendly as possible ,  i cannot really say i understand statements like "it’s absurd to shop at toxic levels in the name of the child that was born to bring peace to the world . " why bring christianity into this ?  not all citizens are confessing to a religion .  that argument simply doesn ' t bite .  and besides ,  the delayed trip to the mall or the grocery store will take place the next day anyway ,  so why bother ?  statements like "what hasn ' t been bought by friday waits until the next week" is really of no ones business but mine .  why force people to spend saturdays shopping and sundays queuing to the ski resorts ?  people ' s spending patterns and leisure time preferences are very different .  shopping free days are in my opinion just a gig invented by the left-wingers to state a point and to feel good about themselves: "for wittwer ,  buy nothing day is a symbolic way of criticising capitalism . " yeah ,  we all understand where your political preference is .  .  .  “i don ' t think it achieves a change in western customers’ attitudes .  it offers consumers an easy way to help make the world better and it gives them a better conscience . ” to your conscience perhaps .  not mine .  what would happen if we all stop consuming ?

__label__0 this is not about expulsion of foreigners why are you all pretending it is ?  there are laws against criminality in this country foreign or otherwise .  call it what it is ,  this is svp  ( they are a brilliant tactical party )  exploiting the dna ingrained xenophobia and general fear of the swiss masses to obtain power .  it ' s mostly harmless though ,  because if they deport a foreigner from germany for instance due to eu laws he is back on the next train .  same goes for most people that are perennial visitors to this country .  the svp and their friends just want power so they can make tons of money !

__label__0 as a naturalised swiss citizen  ( who incidently did not vote for the udc initiative )  i would like to make an obsevation about concerned 2nd and 3rd generation foreigners .  if they are so concerned why don ' t they apply for swiss citizenship ?  it would normally be easily granted unless they have a police record .  they could then vote themselves for or against similar initiatives .  they would of course have to do military service like my sons .  no they want all the priviledges of living in switzerland without the obligations .

__label__0 justdoitq ,  the problem with that approach you suggested ,  leading by example ,  is that it can never bear any fruit when it comes to islam ,  as western europe ' s experiments with that since the 70s can show .  and it ' s extremely important that more and more western european leaders outside of sweden and the uk have begun to understand that .  this whole thing always end up being a one-way street of tolerance of intolerance ,  with non-muslims chipping away at legal equality for all and secular laws in order to accommodate this or that muslim special request and ,  as muslims see that they get whatever special treatment they ask for without giving anything in return ,  the demands only become more numerous and incompatible with our legal systems .  and one of the main reasons for that is that islam dictates that everything and everyone non-muslim is corrupt ,  inferior ,  immoral and has absolutely nothing that muslims can learn from  ( except when it comes to acquiring and using infidel-made weapons .  )

__label__0 carl ,  when you say the right wing panders to the fear of people ,  one could also say that they ' re pointing out a situation where swiss are having to put up with criminal behaviour by those who are guests and not citizens .  schengen is a bucket of worms and other bilateral agreements have tended to homogenize switzerland with the eu .  if the swiss buy into eu all the way ,  they ' ll have lost their self determination .  if you come home to find someone has broken into your home ,  do you cook them a fine dinner and invite them to stay ?  i wouldn ' t . 
__label__0 this anti-gun initiative must be stopped in its tracks .  just look at the uk where almost all guns except flintlocks are banned .  gun crime has increased 5 fold since the last tightening of the laws .  any such ban initiated in switzerland with its traditions would force gun ownership underground ,  lets not do that ! 
__label__0 my son is a dual american and british citizen so clearly you can be a dual british national ! 
__label__0 the uk does not allow dual nationality .  that means that we will have to think very carefully when we meet the requisite 12 years residence criteria about whether to apply .  currently there is very little benefit for spending a large amount of money for my family to become swiss .  all i can see is that i will be able vote in these referendums .  as for the payment to join the club ,  i don ' t really follow the logic .  i mean ,  i have paid and will pay my taxes in future .  the authorities are thus investing in a secure income stream from us for the future .  also i do not see why ,  after 12 years of "getting to know us" ,  living in the same kanton ,  there is a requirement for us to pass some kind of test .  if we had just arrived it would make more sense .  basically by choosing to live here we have opted to be part of the swiss culture and lifestyle .  if we didn ' t like it or want it we would have left  ( as many swiss seem to have done )  .  and if we did not fit in ,  we would be well marked at the gemeinde .  however ,  if the current level of xenophobia keeps spiralling ,  one could argue that the swiss culture and lifestyle no longer exists .  discrimination based on skin colour seems to be endemic - jumping to conclusions is the norm .  "you ' re not from round here" seems to be the message to a lot of immigrants ,  but actually "we are" is the indisputable truth .  for a nation with a basis in tourism this seems to be shooting itself in the foot .  so ,  should i pay to have my kids join in with this ,  or keep our nationality  ( which is more multicultural due to our commonwealth background )  ?  whichever ,  i will still be paying my taxes and enjoying the scenery ,  public transport system ,  quality of living etc etc .

__label__0 switzerland ' s army must remain as is .  it must not comply to any other organization but to its own state .  the momment we join nato we have given up our sovergnty and slowly will fal appart .  this must not happen if we want to preserve our sovergnty as a nation free from opresseive influences .  it surprises me that weakness of our sovergnty is preminecent in such a country wehre patriot pride is part of our daily lives .  i personally feal very risponsible for the freedom of my motherland .  i encourage everyone regardless of their belives to stand up for the army and preserve it as is .  switzerland must not fall victim of the arms and weapons manufacturers .  a good example is the first and second world war ,  if switzerland would to be on any side of the war switzerland and the world would corrently have a far difrent reallity than our current one .  it is very important to be indendent specially when it come to homeland security .  we must be able to defend ourselves of any tirany for tirany is the opressor and switzerland has a great history resisting opression .  so i urge all of you bourjois to clean your eyes for once and for all and be real or suffer the concequences of beeing no longer free
__label__1 the joke of the year ! 
__label__0 if he caught the train that serves my town ,  he ' d probably be very late .  swiss perfection standards have seriously fallen here . 
__label__0 i think the more important point here should be this ,  the us should take any effort they put forth for requesting missionaries in switzerland should remain ,  and instead focus on their own problems at home .  i would say ,  being a resident of switzerland ,  that any missionary work here would be more as a holiday for said missionaries .  they still can come for 6 months holiday if they wish . 
__label__0 to "gallus" and others: lds missionaries are not only inclined to serve the communities they are assigned to ,  but they are also required to do so as a part of their calling .  having been a missionary myself ,  i can tell you that the only motivation is to serve god ' s children in every land .  there are those who disagree with our particular beliefs ,  but we allow all men to believe whatever they wish ,  and worship in their own way .  we only ask to be heard ,  so that every person may decide for themselves how to follow the savior jesus christ .  a note to odette kalman of canada: lds missionaries do not sell bibles .  perhaps you have mistaken them for someone else at your door . 
__label__0 the missionaries are involved in community service in the areas that they serve in .  i lived in the us in an area that was mostly mormon and the religion was a brilliant asset to all in the community . 
__label__0 mormon missionaries ,  just like american government should be encouraged to provide their valuable services to one country above all and that is the united states of america .  europeans could use a breath of fresh air devoid of religious indoctrinations of any kind and outdated american laws .  don ' t call us ,  we ' ll call you  ! 
__label__0 @all lds members: i had asked the question if missionaries to ch are engaged in real community service ,  such as working for the disadvantaged ,  the homeless ,  the drug addicts etc .  not one of you have answered the question with real concrete examples .  sorry ,  but  ' talking about jesus to anyone that cares to listen '  is not a community service in my view . 
__label__1 researchers in the lingustics dept .  at brigham young university have conclusively determined that the second “m” in mormons is a silent “m” . 
__label__0 to max moss of new zealand: there are muslim missionaries in the us
__label__0 i served a mission for the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints in switzerland from 1986 to 1988 .  i am stunned by this decision from a non-participating eu country .  missionaries are a boon to the economy ,  not a draw as they pay for food ,  rent ,  and everything else from funds they earn and save prior to their missions .  missionaries are not paid a dime ,  and they do not seek employment while serving their missions .  i love the swiss people ,  and it is sad to see them so poorly represented by their government . 
__label__1 the mormon church requires all members to pay 10 percent of their income to the mormon church in oder to be in "good standing" and to attend the mormon temple rituals ,  including marriages .  this is required by the very wealthy mormon church .  additionally ,  it should be kept in mind that dna evidence proves beyond any reasonable doubt that the mormon church has been engaged in fraudulent and intentionally deceptive practices for over a century .  also the mormon church gains money from these fraudulent practices .  in the united states ,  there are several recovery groups dedicated to helping families that have been devastated and traumatized because of mormon deceptive practices .  many books have been written on these subjects ,  including the work of geneticist  ( and former mormon )  simon southerton regarding the fraudulent teachings of the mormon church about native americans .  mormonism is not a harmless religion . 
__label__0 mormon missionaries enhance the economy by bringing money into a nation .  they do not compete for jobs .  they provide substantial volunteer services and are encouraged to serve the poor and the needy .  the mormon church encourages national loyalty ,  adherence to law ,  and the strengthening of family ,  community ,  and nation .  every new building underscores a growing number of swiss people who love switzerland .  are a handful of non-eu  ( not just american )  volunteer missionaries not worth this great benefit ?  do the swiss need mormon missionaries ?  they sure do !  so long as switzerland claims to be a free nation with free-thinking people who have the right to act for themselves .  proselyting is just another form of debate --- and no country can claim to be free and refuse proselyting from other peoples .  mormon missionaries bring national growth along with spiritual growth ,  and any swiss citizen that doesn ' t believe this or understand this should speak first with one of the thousands of swiss-national members of the church who would gladly explain that the church celebrates swiss culture just as it does all other cultures of the world .  and one last word to people who think the lord ' s law of tithing is somehow anti-nation: do you argue as vehemently against ,  for example ,  the national tax levied by finland in support of the lutheran church  ( a tax paid whether you are a member of the lutheran church or not )  ?  probably not .  the church does not have a paid ministry .  those monies are used to support buildings  ( aka ,  to pay bills to swiss companies )  .  off the top of my head ,  the only use of tithing funds that might not stay in switzerland would be the purchase of religious materials  ( books ,  pictures ,  etc )  --- but considering the cost of freight over an ocean ,  i ' d be mighty surprised if the church didn ' t use european printers for these items . 
__label__0 whilst the cause of the advocates for "religious neutrality" is in principle a noble one ,  the proponets seem to overlook an important aspect which must be kept in mind when contemplating to remove religious symbols such as crosses in class rooms ,  and later then roosters on churches ,  etc .  these symbols have been present for centuries ,  and until recently this bothered hardly anyone .  why ,  after these many years just now ,  and who started to be offended by their existence ?  this is very likely a certain group of immigrants and their followers whose aim is to change our society and to impose their perception of values .  it is part of a longterm strategy now evident all over europe .  if we give in to such demands and remove those symbols we are in no way installing religious neutrality but rather create a vacuum which will soon be filled with the symbols of the imported cultures ,  and this to be expected with the consent of the multi-culti politicians under the banner of "promoting integration" .  we are still ,  and have been for centuries a christian country and there is no reason whatsoever to depart from it .  how about for example european christians immigrating to the middle east and being vexed by religious symbols such minarets ,  halfmoons and the like ?  and could these european immigrants then expect the support of noble-minded advocates pushing for "religious neutrality" ?  people who do not like or even feel offended by our traditional symbols should either keep quiet or leave the country for a homeland of their proper taste . 
__label__0 i hope it works out  .  its maybe more about culture than religion  .  swiss culture  ,  our culture  . 
__label__0 i believe that crucifictions should be reintroduced ,  as well . 
__label__0 my respect for mr .  marty and his efforts to uncover what really happened in 1999 at kosovo ! 
__label__0 i served a mission ,  and i paid my own way .  in the 1990s .  some missionaries are assisted by the church ,  especially poor ones from poorer countries . this is fair ,  in my opinion .  and the vast majority of lds are non-paid lay leaders at every level ,  from scout leaders and nursery assistants to mission presidents and temple workers . the lds church does provide monetary stipends for travel to a few top leaders ,  and also provides local budgets for millions of members '  activities across the globe . it seems to work .  let non-paid volunteers go where their hearts desire ! 
__label__0 let us ban all missionaries . 
__label__0 i see no reason for the mormons to be a special case here .  the aim of the quota is to restrict the number of non-eu nationals working in switzerland .  the mormon missionaries are working and they are american so they are part of the american quota .  it seems to me that many other americans have much more to offer to the swiss economy than young missionaries trying to convert the swiss to an american cult .  i ' m sure that the young missionaries would have just as much zeal for spreading the word elsewhere .  perhaps those declined entry here should make their way to the camps in somalia ,  or haiti ,  or the gang-ridden streets of mexico ?  it would be the perfect opportunity to bring light where there is darkness
__label__0 from the lds  ( mormon )  perspective ,  i don ' t see why all the missionaries must come from the u . s .  from the non-lds perspective ,  this would be a paid job by any other religion so even if they are paying their own way the american elders are clearly taking away the "job" of self paid service to the lord jesus christ from swiss members that would otherwise be sent elsewhere .  this is a moot point all around .  the work of the lord will be done and it doesn ' t have to all get done by americans .  this is not limiting all missionaries .  the majority of saints are located outside of the u . s .  anyway .  1 peter 2: 13-15 "submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the lord’s sake: whether it be to the king ,  as supreme or unto governors ,  as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers ,  and for the praise of them that do well .  for so is the will of god ,  that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men" follow the word of the lord and we ' ll be fine .

__label__1 to a reader ' s observation ,  it had taken usually a few weeks for then international-participants-on-ssignments to realize something stinky in newly liberated kosovo-1999 ,  about a year for then nato chief commander ,  and about eight years for then prominent pro-separatism human rights fighter-on-a-post ms .  carla del ponte .  good on ya anyway ,  madam . 
__label__0 carla del ponte  (  .  .  .  )  is a very easy target to be recruited ,  by pay and included in projects designed by advocates ,   ( france and russia )  ,  of greater serbia .  there is not a single physical evidence to link kosova and albania with alleged crimes .  in contrary was dick marty that tried to implant forget evidences ,  including human bones at the so called yellow house .  the terrorized owner and his family is pressing charges against dick marty ,  which is nothing more or less a polyagent ,  who works for france and russia with pay . 
__label__1 @digit .  let politicians interfere with monetary policy ?  that ' s madness .  however ,  the mandate of the snb should be revised .  it currently includes only to guarantee price stability .  low inflation is not a holy grail .  the central bank should also be responsible to foster economic growth .  moreover ,  its statutes should be changed to a not for profit company .  it is unacceptable that the snb is hindered in its activities by political pressure to maximize profits or avoid losses .   ( majority shareholders are the cantons and public entities - they expect a hefty dividend each year that is included in their respective budgets .  ) 
__label__1 there were many incidents of terrorism before kosovo declared unilateral declaration of independence .  recognition of kosovo is still disputed and it is not a member of the united nations even three years after the secession .  switzerland as a neutral country should not have taken sides . 
__label__0 today ,  almost every diplomat from the west that i speak with in my daily profession ,  say it straight out that it was a wrong move to recognize kosovo .  also ,  a handful of western countries are really reconsidering to redraw their recognition .  it has been proved and is surely going to be proved ,  that serbia did bad and wrong things ,  but maybe 5% of those things that were stated from the beginning of the conflict .  when asking around today in world top level diplomatic circles ,  no one believe that kosovo will ever be a country by itself . 
__label__0 stop being redicilious .  dick marty is nothing but a raving lunatic well known for these qualities around western europe .  there is no truth on what he says ,   (  no evidence is provided ) and he is just making an idiot out of himself and continuing on the mad anti albanian path that another lunatic c d ponte paved for him .  common people use some common sense .  everyone knows what happened in kosovo .  no kosovar had the facilities or technology to don what mr marty describes in his draft . i doubt as the technology to do organ harvesterin exists nowdays in kosovo let alone 11 years ago .  common it ' s crazy  .  this is just a pro serbian  (  probably paid by them )  idiot coming up with with a never proven idiotic draft report . 
__label__0 this is all imagination of serbia goverment in order to stop recognition of kosova ,  stop 2milion people to play in any international tournament ,  have the rigth to move anywhere without visa and all the bad thing that is happening to kosovo citizens .  the kla was the only hope not to be masacred as in other places like serbs did in kosova ,  remember recak , prekaz .  this report is not true and is supported by serbia .  you will see at the end that all of thise was not true . 
__label__0 it ' s always nice to finally hear the truth ,  however .  .  .  how will you turn back the hands of time now ?  it was wreckless to simply believe media interpretations during those conflicts .  so much of the  ' news '  was fabricated to demonize the serbs .  di a little deeper and you ' ll find that bin laden also visited kosovo and was well known within the albanian cirlces that  ' liberated '  kosovo .  sad that so many eu countries so quickly attacked an ally nation  ( serbia )  to support terrorists . 
__label__0 why the international community closes its eyes on genocide made in kosovo by serbia ,  15000 k / albanians were killed 1500 are still missing .  why mr .  marty are supporting a state sins of the fact that has destroyed the entire former jugosalaviju ,  killing thousands of people .  anyway let it be in his honor ,  but justice always arrives even late . 
__label__0 what`s wrong with this dick marty if he is pro-serb it is his own business .  the war of kla was saint they fought for liberation from the serbs .  the guy from denimark kosova is state and it will be as long as there will 2 millions of albanians .  serbia did not do 5 % of crime but 100% ,  a lot of albanians witnessed crimes that they did .  it`s so easy for you because you forgot your wars you dont even what`s that .  serbs also did the ethnic cleansing they did the miseries in kosova . 
__label__0 albanians never were qonquers of any nation  ,  contrary the serb`s regime against kosovo albanians is real story that can not be denied  ,  what should the democratic world is that we shoul make a diffrence between the people who pained on this regime and the people or maybe is beter to say the military who commited this cromes in albanians people ,  we have yet mothers who cries and hav a hope that one day their familiars will turn back the can not find their bodies we have a lot of women who left without husband  ,  alot of them has been raped  ,  we have a children who has left without parents  , for six days serbian forces dissimilated about 300 villages from kosova  ,  killing and reaping people  ,  dick marty shout deal with this not with something that make a big oath for albanians in general because we never qonquered someone and we will never qonquer somone but we will work with all international comunity  .  america ,  eu  ,  nato to move forward with processes that one time and forever albanian to win that what is always denied especially by this kind of people like marty for kosova and for all albaninan in general . let the international court deal with this beccause albanian always are and will be ready to cooperate with this institution and not to deal with utterances said by persons who are well paid by serbs and other intellengences agencies .  , 
__label__0 do you people have any idea how hard it is to remove and transport organs ?  the conditions have to be perfect ,  100% sterile operation rooms and loads of high tech equipment .  if you ask doctors about their professional opinion ,  they will laugh at the thought itself let alone discuss it further .  people of kosovo are not denying some of the crimes that thaqi might have been involved in ,  but allegations of organ trafficking are simply ridiculous .  i think dick marty has been watching to many science fiction films and serbia has been paying lot of money in production .  we all know how desperate serbia is ,  and throughout the history serbs have proven rather well that they are more than capable of distorting the truth ,  cmon ,  serbs have been raised  ( from school education in their biology classes )  wit the general knowledge which include claims that albanians are born with tails ,  as in part human part animal .  the organ trafficking simply doesn ' t stand a chance ,  although there could have been isolated cases .  and ah yes ,  most of the drugs that pass through kosovo are paid for and cut in serbia ,  therefore it would be better if serbia cleans up their yard before anything .  i personally don ' t like thaqi and his "friends" ,  but this is just plain stupid .  people of the world ,  wake up and don ' t be so naive ,  serbs are known for this !  ! 
__label__0 marty acknowledged the scarcity of physical evidence on thursday but said that it would be the task of judicial investigators to unearth this .  that ' s not a defence !  that ' s a total and shameful try to escape the responsibility of it ' s own declarations !  he declared he ' s got the evidences from trusted sources !  well it ' s time to show them or to declare he ' s a charlatan !

" gun control is a 20th century contrivance ,  the goal of which is not to reduce violence ,  but to consolidate power into the hands of central governments .  those who trust such governments with that power are ignorant of history .

__label__0 i think housing prices should counter act inflation just as inflation should be prevented but this will not end until the day of those who rob the wealth of the country finally get slammed by the law agood example is the defecit the mormons make with their 10% and other products that their forcefully sell to their congregates ,  what happens here is that they make a defecit and turning it into a surpluss in their headquarters in utah this makes local markets to experience an unhealthy unsustainable form of inflation thus aswell increasing the national debt ,  what we see here is that zug is finally starting to weakup from this but hopefully they have cleaned their eyes properly because just as digit says it ' s the big corporations kicking out the locals ,  just like in andermatt ,  they are getting a big spender to come on down and slowly kick the locals out once they cannot keep up with property value and tax ,  now if the locals of andermatt would have had been smart they would have build a damn resort anyways but the resort could have had been owned by the andermatt thus reducing taxes and creating funds for insentives for locals to create new business but instead do to unwillingness of the people they have no become victims of the wolf ,  i urge all the swiss to use logic .  remeber if you are not genuingly united one wolf can eat a whole village ,  just look outside your window and start standing up against foreign corporations that are intending to destitute the real people of the most beautifull nation of the world

__label__0 increasing prices wont solve majority of the problem but it will make a lot of money for the rail owners .  the cheaper solution would be to have diferrent carriage configurations during rush hours where there can be add on carraiges to trains and trams .  with some stations having limited length of loading space a dual stop approach can be a considered option .  where if you cant squeeze into the first number of carraiges then there is a 2nd chance .

(  and even if the child is not doped up ,  the pedophile relative is not going to be refused anyway because the aggressor is very persuasive and manipulative in their actions .  so no ,  incest is a crime and should remain as such  .  .  .  even upgraded to crime against humanity . 
__label__0 i am somewhat relieved by the other feedback i see here .  aside from differing opinion ,  i am a bit disappointed by the poor journalistic standards of this article .  swissinfo ,  please stay credible : (  . 
__label__0 my country could take a lot of lessons here !  when all the citizens are trained and armed ,  they tend to be a little more polite .  the united states has far too many politicians and members of the "news" media working to destroy a good thing , rather than creating unity within a nation .  i seriously doubt anyone heard "explosions" , likely a lot of small arms fire , same as at any rifle and pistol range .  .  .  why is it that the media and politicians can ' t focus on dealing with the criminal elements of society and leave the rest of us alone ? 
__label__0 @rene .  no i have been lucky enough never been involved in any direct violence but i have done a short tour in the uk military which does get involved in conflicts in contrast to the swiss army .  my best friend at the time did do a tour in northern ireland while the troubles were on and i saw what that did to him .  i don ' t see why my statement is absurd .  take it to the extreme - remove every single gun from the country .  now there can be no gun deaths .  now put one back in the system .  there can be a gun death but it ' s very unlikely because we ' ll know exactly where the gun is and what it ' s doing .  now add another and another until you get back to today ' s situation and today ' s statistics .  less guns = less gun deaths .  how is that not reasonable ? 
__label__0 suicides aren ' t controlled by laws restricting guns but thugs are empowered by them . 
__label__0 i guess there are ex felons who lead exemplary lives and who would bebefit from legal gun ownership .  likewise there are lots of cured ex mental patients who deserve the right of self defense .  how do i know that somebody might not drink too much alcohol ,  get ahold of a car or a knife ,  and kill someone .  clarence darrow ,  a famous attorney wrote this about alcohol laws : "if the doctrine should prevail that when sixty per cent of the people of a country believe that certain conduct should be  ( a )  criminal offense and for that conduct they must send forty per cent to jail ,  then liberty is dead and freedom is gone .  .  . "
__label__0 correction for the last post ,  should read "tries to +extend+ gun controls" not  ' reduce '  - sorry .  @rene: you kind of suggest that you ' re swiss and that you were around in wwii but i don ' t think you are all that you pretend to be are you ?  shouldn ' t your name be rené and not rene or don ' t you have an é on your keyboard ?  and 75+ years old ?  you might be but .  .  .  and what about europe at peace since wwii ?  well what about the troubles in ni .  and the falklands ?  and iraq ?  and afghanistan ?  i don ' t live in a narrow dreamworld about peace .  i live in europe . 
__label__0 democracy can be two wolves and a sheep voting on what ' s for dinner .  swiss people: do not give up your human right to own weapons .  in this regard you are the only remaining jewel in europe !  god bless you . 
__label__0 is there any wonder why the swiss enjoy a low crime rate and a history of never having been invaded by a foreign power for centuries ?  it says much when the very people themselves ,  armed with weapons of contemporary technology ,  are in the vanguard of the defense of their country and their communities . 
__label__0 yes well ,  update 2011 the article doens ' t mention the electoral  ( democratic )  vicctory of hamas .  .  .  .  i might point out that the grave that gaza is has grown a little deeper ,  there are now no functionning cancer / oncology facilites ,  the sick can only travel outside for treatment exceptionaaly and after a long wait ,  and water purification equipment and supplies remain verboten by the diktats of the occupying power it is in the interest of all that hope may return
__label__0 banning weapons will be a greater acces for corruption .  the reason corruption is not so emminent in switzerland is because politicians feel the threat of their constituents ,  not because they have high levels of respect towards them ,  it is because most of them are well armed .  this creates the current environment in the political field .  what can be done is as how i said in another report is that gun owners should go for a pscycological assesment and with the conclutions of such assesment decide to weather or not "x" individual if mentaly fit to port a weapon .  this will still keep the threat to the politicians that do good do to the existing threat .  just look at the statistics in democracy and crime in places where weapons are banned .  that is why switzerland must not disolve it ' s army and thats why switzerland must not allow such a dum idea .  we have to remeber we are humans and human nature is a nature of survival and the only way humans cooporate with eachother is because they are both under threat of eachother ,  so instead of worring about how to betray eachother we worry hiow can we cooporate efficiently ,  without the existance of threat we are confidante of ourselfes and non willing to cooporate with others
__label__0 this is a sad carryover from my earlier feedback on the "swiss guns surprise tourists" article .  to repeat ,  we live in a violent world .  some places more than others .  .  . but who would expect uber quiet zug  ( my town )  or an unincorporated berg in arizona to be the site of such horrendous tragedies ?  the most dangerous thing in human society are the humans .  period .  while guns can make killing more effecient ,  the weapons dont load ,  aim and fire themselves .  maybe we need to tackle the twin roots of the issue .  .  . taking combat weapons out of the hands of civilians as well as strict licensing to weed out as many of the nut jobs as possible .  in essence ,  the crime was letting a 22 yr old who has a criminal record own and carry in public a glock 19 pistol  ( one of the easiest weapons to fire )  equipped with a 30 round magazine  ( stnd issue is 10 rounds )  .

__label__1 can you explain how switzerland can produce 1 . 03 million hectoliters in 1 year ,  but drink 2 . 757 million of domestic  ( so must be swiss )  in the same year ?  that doesn ' t sound particularly sustainable .  .  . 
__label__0 this report borders upon being outright political propaganda .  the major parties of europe have decided to pull out all the stops and try to save the euro .  part of that strategy is to get switzerland to buy more and more euro bonds from the pigs .  in other words ,  the swiss are being encouraged to buy worthless paper by the people who sent europe broke .  this idea that swiss exports are getting more expensive is just crazy .  it is infantile in its reasoning .  when countries debase the value of their currency by printing money ,  of course imports seem more expensive .  but they are not more expensive ,  in real terms .  they just cost more of the less valuable currency .  if switzerland debases its currency by getting involved in the insane euro game ,  it will then need to pay more for the commodities it needs to manufacture exports .  then it ' s exports will be more expensive anyway .  why ?  because debasing a currency does not change how much value is in the commodities one needs to buy to exercise industrial capacity .  you always need to pay that value ,  or you can ' t have the commodity .  it is called "trade" .  this idea that by debasing the value of the swiss franc the bankers will achieve something worthwhile is treasonous .  it puts the interests of those who own the european project ahead of the people who live and work and vote in switzerland .  it is also insane ,  in intellectual terms .  we are being told that if we all print money ,  then everything will be just fine .  my question is "when will these bankers shut up ?  how much damage do these people need to do before they shut up ,  and working people stop being taxed to give them more money for their schemes ? "

__label__0 patsy ,  as a fellow irelander ,  i ' m surprised at your position on guns .  regardless ,  relating guns at home and crime levels is not really the point .  wanting to keep guns at home is like wanting to drive at 200 kph ,  or wanting to ride a bike without a helmets .  i like the wild side as much as anybody ,  but i accept that society is trying to mature .

__label__1 the government accountability office likes to point its finger at luxembourg and the cayman islands for sheltering tax cheats .  but according to the u . k . -based tax justice network ,  the united states is the biggest tax shelter of  ' em all ,  thanks to the great state of delaware .  delaware ,  says the tax justice network ,  is "the most secretive financial jurisdiction in the world . " that ' s based on an analysis of 60 financial jurisdictions according to level of secrecy and cooperation with foreign tax authorities .  luxembourg comes in second ,  followed by the switzerland ,  the cayman islands ,  and the united kingdom .  here are some fun facts about delaware ,  per tjn ' s release: * according to the delaware secretary of state ' s office their operating budget was $12 million in 2007 and they made $24 million in the fees for expedited incorporation filings alone .  * there are currently some 695 , 000 active entities registered in delaware ,  including 50 percent of the corporations publically traded on the u . s .  stock exchange .  * new business formations in delaware are currently running at about 130 , 000 per annum .  * the growth of private individual deposits by non-residents was most robust in the united states outranking other popular financial jurisdictions such as the cayman islands ,  united kingdom ,  and luxembourg with total non-resident deposits equalling $2 . 6 trillion in 2007 .  nicole tichon of u . s .  pirg ,  probably the foremost homegrown tax-haven basher ,  said the united states needs to get its tax act together .  "if the u . s .  wants to be taken seriously by the international community and try to get their cooperation ,  then we ' ve got to crack down on what ' s going on here at home .  we can ' t have it both ways , " said tichon .  "bank secrecy breeds the same problems ,  the same criminal behavior ,  and puts up the same roadblocks to law enforcement regardless of where it occurs .  as long as the u . s .  government looks the other way ,  it diminishes our credibility on this issue . " the obama administration talked a good game at first about clamping down on u . s .  corporations that abuse tax shelters ,  but the administration has since waffled .

__label__0 i am all for switzerland replacing energy sources with better ,  more efficient energy and withdrawing from nuclear .  however ,  until alternative "green" energy comes is widely available  (  70 % or more of swiss requirements  )   .  .  .  and this cheaper or at the same price as currently ,  i do not see switzerland stopping it .  besides ,  if we become dependent on the eu for energy ,  we are doomed to join the eu  .  .  .  .  .  .  and that would simple wipe switzerland off the map as we know it today  .  .  .  .  no thank you ,  my vote will be yes to the nuclear energy plant .  we can build 10 plants if need be ,  we can sell the surplus to the eu  .  .  .  .  .  be a producer of more than we need .  let the eu pay for our investment . 
__label__0 i agree that nuclear energy should be replaced by safe alternatives ,  but where are they ?  all we hear of is water ,  solar and wind ,  but actually whenever such a project exists it is aggressively fought back by exactly those who also fight nuclear .  it looks to me like the green theory is: power-generation yes ,  but not here where we can insure the maximum possible cleanliness based on swiss standards .  .  .

__label__0 @tia .  you are right - military arms at home would not stop an invasion .  the real issue is to maintain traditions and trust towards the citizen .  i had been in the army for some 25 years and kept my automatic rifle plus war ammunition at my house .  had killing someone ever crossed my mind ,  i would certainly have used an unregistered pistol bought on the black market .  shooting is a national sport and also an obligation for army personnel .  in practice ,  arsenals have proven not to be much safer than homes but a lot more inconvenient for those who want or have to do shooting exercises .  during my army time ,  ammunition was packaged in sealed cans and braking it open was sanctioned with a stay in the swiss "guantanamo" prison for soldiers .  if the existing laws are respected ,  letting soldiers keep their arms  ( without ammunition )  is no more dangerous for the citizens living in this country than delivering driving licenses .

__label__0 ben’s point .  .  .  is fundamentally sound: guns were designed first and foremost to kill people .  this is why they replaced longbows and crossbows in the armouries of european armies ,  and the contention that ‘guns don’t kill people ,  people do’ is best tested simply by imagining the us marines being equipped with sets of kitchen knives rather than firearms whenever they are sent on their next foreign adventure .  .  .

__label__0 a chinese proverb states: the longest journey starts with the first step .  of course changes will not take root overnight ,  but a start has to be made .  and the west needs to stay out of this .  it is none of our business what kind of government those people choose .  they don ' t meddle in our affairs .  we don ' t really have their well-being at heart ,  we only have our well-being at heart .  .  . at their expense . 
__label__0 @max ,  switzerland: good point but i ' d like to see a listing of the nations that colonized africa and other continents a long time ago ,  some of them still "cashing in on" ,  and living of the plundering of their former territories .  countries now left in despair and turmoil are evidently now ruled by the apprentices of the former occupants .

__label__0 ubs please come to singapore and bring credit suisse with you .  we like tax money ,  the swiss have probably found oil or gold in the alpes ,  who knows .  and no ,  the taxpayer got all his money back and more .  and the national bank doesn ' t want to sell the "toxic assets" back to ubs ,  because they are right now making money with it .  wake up and stop kicking one of your major contributor to wealth .

__label__1 "the arabist" ,  a blog of writer and journalist of egypt took sometimes ago about 30 , 000 political inmates under mubarack and rigth now took about hundreds of protester in the jail ,  even they have a list with names in the website .  this interview is like dreaming with a thriller of a hollywood film with a happy ending ,  so sweet ,  for europeans taste to believed that is the true .  you are offering a "bocati di cardinale" to the listener in europe ,  not the true in egypt . 
__label__0 ra ' s mention of japan is based on the utterly false assumption that everyone has the same mentality and values around the world .  japan is populated overwhelmingly by people raised in a culture where hard work is a cornerstone of a kind of society which bears no resemblance to what switzerland would look like if it did anything remotely resembling what he has suggested .  if that happened ,  switzerland would most likely end up like yemen or sudan . 
__label__0 this is a very negative precident ,  freezing assets witin 24hrs of a resignation ,  where were the swiss during the last 30 years ?  does basel and the basel accord know something the publicdoes not know about the monetary system ?  very scary . 
__label__0 a gun is a tool .  it is a tool for a very specific job .  in a vacuum ,  having a firearm gives you parity or superiority to anyone else .  if they are similarly armed you ' re on their level .  if you are armed and they are not you have a significant advantage .  having a gun means that no one can dominate you without significant risk to themselves .  they are dangerous and must be treated with respect .  but treating them fearfully does no one any good .  criminals will not care that guns are illegal .  they may be harder to obtain but a criminal is already comfortable breaking the law .  it just means that law abiding citizens have a harder time protecting themselves  (  .  .  .  ) 
__label__0 long live swiss traditions of freedom and individual responsibility ! 
__label__0 50 years ago the vote on this referendum would have been 80% no .  switzerland is slowly losing it ' s traditional values on firearms and bank secrecy .  is the ascendancy of women in swiss politics partly responsible for this ?  swiss government is still a great political model for the rest of the world .  but it ' s also sadly possible that switzerland ' s best days may be in the past . 
__label__0 brilliant news .  good on you swiss voters .  you have done everyone inside your borders and outside a great service by protecting your right to not change your traditions .  protect your citizen military ,  protect your farmers and you can rest easy . 
__label__0 the swiss suicide rate is lower than that of france and far lower than that of japan so clearly there is no connection between suicide and firearm availability ,  the liberals are just clinging to this pathetic justification because they don ' t have high crime rates to blame on guns in switzerland like in the us and elsewhere .  rolf: if you "don ' t understand" why the swiss would want to keep their guns then maybe you should educate yourself instead of condemning them .

__label__0 how ironic of le tribune de genève to talk about "modern switzerland" losing a battle .  i wonder where its idea of "modernity" comes from ?  possibly from its out-of-control crime rates ,  which swissinfo has reported on and which "old and backwards switzerland" has decided it wants nothing to do with .  that ' s certainly one more reason to perhaps give geneva residents a chance to vote on whether or not they want to become a sovereign entity ,  with soaring crime rates ,  crook-cuddling and all these "modern things" which are so popular in their canton . 
__label__0 you`re from spain .  if you`re a nadal lover and federer hater go whine somewhere else . 
__label__1 how many jews committed suicide when they lost hope after hitler confiscated all their weapons ?  a few extra gun-related suicides are still a lot less than a dictator killing millions of his own people .  and then how many more lives are lost when the people have had enough and are willing to risk their life over throwing said dictator ?  and i bet the same people who are so concerned about suicides are okay with abortion which is far higher . 
__label__0 the swiss court ruled here specifically on whether being persecuted for being gay is a ground for refugee status .  the court did not argue that all non-swiss convicted criminals must be sent back .  they ,  instead ,  essentially argued that as long as he doesn ' t flaunt it ,  he might not be discovered and then can maybe survive in iran .  is that legal reasoning ?  will he be handed over to iran in handcuffs like many other repatriated asylum seekers and criminal ?  how can he hide ? 
__label__0 cs managed to seel these coco bonds to qatar and saudi arabia !  so if theres a popular democracy uprising there ,  then we can happily "freeze" these assets till oblivion !  problem solved .  so a clear & clean suggestion for ubs and cs is to take money to help fulfill the "baseliii + swiss finish" obligations is to take money only from "shady ,  un-democratic" regimes .  .  .  hail helvetica ! 
__label__0 @vera gottlieb: you are correct ,  financial privacy is not a human right .  yet ,  in switzerland ,  it is part of the citizens '  private sphere that is guaranteed by our laws .  however ,  they do not protect corrupt politicians and criminals  ( the latter within the definition our our laws )  . 
__label__0 personally i am against people running away from their country as soon as there is a problem .  why don ' t they stay and sort it out ?  some of these migrants will be opportunists who are using the situation to move to a richer country .  turn them back  !

__label__0 switzerland and good customer service is an oxymoron .  while swiss service workers do present facts and handle issues in a very knowledgable ,  matter of fact way ,  the delivery of such can rarely be considered friendly . 
__label__0 swiss service is rumoured to be the best in the world .  swiss hotel schools use this idea to attract students from abroad ,  yet the reality is somewhat different .  service is included in the bills you pay .  which means the staff know that even if they do a bad job ,  upsetting the customers ,  they will still get paid .  so ,  they should get say 50% fixed salary and have to work for the rest .  that should improve the service . 
__label__0  .  .  . maintaining a strong presence abroad is not just about the financial returns .  how true !  i hope the government remembers that when making a final decision about funding this website ! 
__label__0 to put it bluntly the only happy swiss i ' ve seen are the swiss abroad . speaks volumes really . 
__label__0 appreciate the swiss support to retrieve the stolen money back . 
__label__0 i was there for two years .  what i understood is that libyan government is good to you as long as you behave like a farm chicken .  otherwise it is as merciless as human beings are towards mosquitoes .  when mosquito is sucking our blood ,  we simply slap it flat instantly so that it will be more to trouble you .  that ' s the philosophy of the regime . 
__label__0 the aloof politicians need to get real about the policing situation in geneva .  numerous posts are unfilled for several years ,  criminals are allowed to pour in across the borders ,  no wonder the police are fed up !  they cannot go on strike ,  so this is the only way it seems to get through to intransigient do-gooders who do not understand the difference between a criminal and a victim and the vital role of the police in maintaining people ' s security . 
__label__0 hopefully one president that doesn ' t need to steal from his people ! 
__label__0 president behgjet pacolli is a great man - a man of honor and good faith with an international political and business reputation all over the globe .  i know him very well as a business partner ,  a friend and a great personality in our controversial times .  he is able to lead kosovo republic to its european destiny up to the corridors of united nations bringing peace ,  happiness and a good life standard to kosovo citizens .  no other than pacolli is able to promote both diplomatic relations to serbia ,  russia ,  usa and eu combined to economic development ,  progress and prosperity to 2 . 2 million citizens of kosovo .  kosovo nation is young ,  strong ,  hard working and ambitious .  pacolli started his personal career as a poor emigrant to germany ,  austria ,  italy ,  switzerland ,  he studied finance ,  worked for many years in interplastica como ,  started mabetex adventure early 90s and became a strong construction and business tycoon in so many areas .  there is nothing to hide in his career ,  he is transparent ,  honest ,  strong and brilliant in all life aspects .  no mystery ,  no secrets ,  no magic ,  no wonders ,  ever existed in his life except hard work ,  commitment ,  intelligence ,  strong alliances and strategic view .  be sure that within few years kosovo will become a proud nation in europe capable to feed its people and be a model for many other countries in the region . 
__label__0 i can understand full well where this billionaire kosovar got his wealth !  !  from hard work .  yugoslavs ,  ex ygoslavs and kosovars ,  are very motivated to work hard ,  and they think hard ,  and yes they work hard .  i have witnessed after the bosnian war ,  young waiters who could not get jobs in switzerland due different educational standards ,  so they could only work as waiters .  i know lawyers , and fighter pilots ,  who were waiters here in switzerland .  i also still know these good people ,  and they are worth alot more than alot of people around them because they saw an opportunity and worked 7days a week .  yes some have connections ,  but only the lucky few . 
__label__1 please read blick of sat ,  feb 19th as well as blick ' s web edition of today .  nestlé seem to be loosing war .

__label__0 it is like this here .  we kosovars must do for ourselves and not always wait for help .  it is still like old time when all things was decided by the state in a communist way .  if we want to be accepted then we must so some thing for responsibility our selfs .  we have smart and now with good education young peoples to be some thing as an independent country . i am proud to be kosovar but we her in kosova have to make more for to have a good strong and honest country . 
__label__0 this is an equation that pits humans vs .  humans with a machine .  people will walk out believing they have the right away no matter what !  this is a bad decision !  by law you do ,  by the laws of physics you dont !  look before you go i always say .  i have seen numerous times where people just walk without looking .  i trust very few people with my life !  on the other side there are people who drive like complete a**es as if they own the road !  or a person may not be seen due to many variables . 
__label__1 with all respect to the people involved ,  the whole thing sounds to me very suspicious .  from what i understand ,  this company is trying to sell a device which uses the sun to heat the water in order to purify it ,  so far so good .  does that mean that people living in rural areas don ' t have the means to start an even rudimental fire and boil the damned water themselves ?  there surely are means to heat the water using a simple set of mirrors for christ ' s sake .  it sounds to me just like selling vitamin c capsules in mallorca ,  where there ' s a huge aboundance of oranges and lemons ,  which are way healthier than any pill .  what i see here is yet another stunt aiming at profiting from poor and uneducated folks .  just like we do to ourselves ,  creating the needs in order to sell each other totally useless crap ,  here we seek profit from ignorance and the good faith of these peoples ,  who don ' t understand the profit mechanism just as we westerns don ' t .  heating the water from the sun is a very simple process ,  no rocket science .  if these people don ' t have enough resources to boil the water themselves ,  then it will be very easy to create a device from scrap materials ,  it ' d be enough to just give them the know-how .  but no ,  we sell these things for 500$ so that only a few can afford them and a whole bunch of brainwashed folks will stop finding solutions themselves !  !  !  and you call that help ? 
__label__0 wow - the swiss empire is beginning ,  without a war .  first they take over kosovo .  where ' s next ?  where could giving foreigners the swiss nationality lead ?  forget europe ,  the swiss are going to take over the world .

__label__0 how is it that mubarak ' s assets were freezed very swiftly and yet gaddafi and his family clan still have access to the millions they stole from the libyan people ?  given the troublesome swiss-libyan relationship of late ,  the swiss government should act decisively to hit back at these despots were it hurts most . 
__label__1 i ' m desperate to come and live in southwestern switzerland ,  somewhere close to lausanne and geneva .  as a well qualified automotive engineer ,  with extensive managerial experience ,  authoring experience ,  and a  ' can do '  attitude which has driven me to achieve what i have so far ,  i ' m hoping to find employment  ( ideally in my field ,  but not necessarily so )  to enable me to come and resettle my family there .  any offers or helpful suggestions greatly appreciated ! 
__label__0 just outside of boston ,  a large company lobbied effectively to build an executive headquarters on an ex-horse farm near a small mountain .  it was built despite protests of interested citizens .  within five years ,  the company moved out leaving a building in a field and no employment benefit for the municipality .  be careful in giving away your beautiful lands as  ( among other things )  you risk getting vacant urbanization .  good luck ! 
__label__0 there is a way to help these bankers if their clients were not federal employees of any type or did not elect to have their earnings treated like that of a statutory "u . s .  person" .  the presumption of tax liability game the us government plays is directed only toward those who are statutory "u . s .  persons" .  one must fully realize that statutory "u . s .  persons" are only legal fictions .  the swiss-american tax treaty only addresses statutory "u . s .  persons" and does not extend toward americans who are not a  ' legal fiction '  .  the us tax court has issued over 30 court orders for lack of jurisdiction to americans who were purported by the irs in a notice of deficiency document to be statutory "u . s .  persons" .  the irs lost their claim of presumption against those americans and a similar approach can be used to help these 3 swiss bankers and the singular italian banker .  .  . 
__label__0 good - the sooner the swiss wake up to this mess in the backyard and help to clean it up ,  the better for the whole country . 
__label__0 what your readers do not realize is that the ubs whistleblower ,  bradley birkenfeld ,  is the man who also revealed credit suisse  ( cr )  to u . s .  authorities in 2007 .  birkenfeld used to work for cr and he explained how cr operated its business and also identified mr .  adami as the main man in the u . s .  operation for cr .  you have to wonder why it took over 3 and a half years for the justice department to act on birkenfeld ' s information .  but this is a cautionary tale for all bankers who might think of entering the u . s .  - or even connecting to a flight in a u . s .  airport .  don ' t even think of doing it .  the u . s .  has obviously obtained the names of many ,  many private bankers .  these bankers have either been secretly been indicted  ( they call it a sealed indictment )  or have "material witness" warrants issued which permits authorities to apprehend them as they land at a u . s .  airport .  any banker who works at a swiss bank is crazy to ever step foot on u . s .  soil again .  they ' re waiting for you . 
__label__0 the us expat in suisse and the comment from australia are correct .  the problem they see is that they are using their own definition of the term  ' u . s .  citizen '  .  the us gov uses their statutory definitions only and the us gov meaning is far different than what is meant in everyday definitions .  a  ' u . s .  citizen '  is defined at 8 usc 1401 ( a )  to mean "a  ' person '  born in the  ' united states '  ,  and subject to its jurisdiction .  a  ' person '  defined by the usc means a statutory creation of the us congress .  the us expat and australian mean those americans born in the 50 states of the union only .  big difference .  .  . and that is where americans get snared by the us gov . 
__label__0 as a frequent tourist and "tour guide" for our students ,  visiting switzerland is a must on our european fieldtrips .  however ,  increasing the price of transportation to discourage me from "traveling" might surely have an affect on how many students we bring to the alpine villages which in turn will have an impact on the local villagers '  tourist income .  it ' s already very very expensive for us to travel in switzerland .  .  . now you want us to travel only at specific times of the day  ( or night )  in order to get a decently priced train ticket ?  sadly it makes me think that switzerland does not hold the patent on "beautiful scenery" and may find itself scratched off our itinerary .  that ' s definitely not something i would want to do - but something i may have to do . 
__label__0 this is the right thing to do .  let ' s hope that steps are taken to prevent despots from amassing such fortunes in the future . 
__label__0 funny thing is the imported goods to switzerland have not changed in price at the retail level .  we still get ripped off for cars ,  groceries and just about every other item .  cars is particular are a true source of my irritation .  an audi q7 costs double the usa price even though the currency is similar is value .  the few swiss that run the retail infrastructure have been screwing swiss people for years and it is time for it to stop .  interestingly the usa had a high value dollar for years and the economy was super strong .  so let ' s not link the value to any "business" problems ,  because i believe that is just not the case . 
__label__0 everything about the "strong franc" being a problem is just wrong .  the strong franc is not the problem .  the weak euro and us dollar are the problem .  all the measures and threats to the swiss economy portrayed in this article smack of propaganda .  propaganda aimed to encourage the artificial erosion of the swiss franc as a sound currency .  a company that risks insolvency is simply a badly run company .  as the purchasing power of the euro and us dollar drop ,  costs rise anyway ,  so operating with or without the swiss franc is irrelevant . 
__label__0 the second part of your statement is absolutely correct .  the reason for the franc ' s excessive strength is fear and heavy speculation .  according to the ppp index  ( purchasing power parity )  developed by the oecd ,  the swissie is overvalued by 38% against euro and 46% against u . s .  dollar . 
__label__0 by the time the un agrees on something and shoots one bullet in the direction of the enemy ,  this bullet will cost 10 million dollars .  the un is the most useless gang ever perpetrated on the stupid naive taxpayer the world over .  it is not the banking crisis that will bankrupt the western world ,  it is the diplomats ,  the un the astronomical cost that these enteties use up to get some consensus .  all the while they are also the same elite who create the very same wars they then convince us that they alone can stop .  has anyone asked their respective governments to show the true cost of their participation in this so called un ?

__label__0 @justin  .  .  .  .  no ,  justin ,  it is not whatever dogma  .  .  .  it is blatant "heart-on-your-sleeve-ism" .  ai and its ilk need to take a hard look at the meaning of democracy  .  .  .  .  and when you come upon the part where  .  .  . " .  .  .  the choice of the people .  .  . "  .  .  .  .  .  is mentioned ,  they need to really sit down and think about what that really means here in switzerland  .  .  .  .  we - the voting swiss - are not ignorant yokels who have limited education and no notion of whats going on .  we vote and apply the laws we want ,  not the bleeding heart ideals of ai .

__label__0 i think if a person has a mental illness they should be able to have assisted suicide if they are of right mind . 
__label__0 as a schizophrenic myself ,  i believe mentally ill people should be allowed assisted suicide ,  because mental suffering is much worse than physical suffering ,  and if it is chronic and incurable ,  as is the case for schizophrenia ,  becomes a hell of misery that people should never be forced to endure for a lifetime .  i believe assisted suicide is a true human right . 
__label__0 these francs created by the snb for the imf are a bailout of the german and french private banks that loaned the money certain eu countries .  these private banks should take their losses ,  not be subsidized by swiss citizens .  if swiss citizens really wants to help ,  just buy the near worthless assets from the private banks at face value ,  write them down to zero ,  and move on . 
__label__1 god bless them ,  gadaffi well they should surrender ,  really it ' s in their contious ,  now what it amazing of it all is that the gadaffi ' s them selves are willing to die for what they seem to believe of rightious glory of the 3 books ,  now i question why is it that they actually did not imp[y it in full ,  they seemed to be missing on something that is causing his culture to say that they have had enough of beeing ignored and exploited to the one who should be listenning to advaice of his people considering everyone equal and with infinite potential ,  instead gdaffi dared to control for he was scared of not beeing in control ,  but the best leader is the one who asks logical questions and listens to the answers and takes contientious charge towards achieving positive procurement for his society ,  peole have to start living on ethical healthy living and one thing i do thank gadafi for and all this other nutheads is that they have made peopel live for what they believe in and hopefully history whill in fact no longer repeat it ' s self ,  i wish them all a great new positive future where humans can start to be allowed to be contributers to evolution of our minds ,  democracy is the structure that allows humans to interact and thus it is very important that we all venerate the laws and make sure that the law never brakes human dignity ,  we shall see in the next years to come into weather people can stay away from lust and bribery and have dignity and honer twards honesty ,  that is the difinition of what direction humans should take if we want to see democracy to flurish for what it is meant god bless all those who are rightios and god forgive the naive

__label__0 i cannot find the place where the constitution guarantees "free choice of transport" in the sense mr . kirchhofer of astag suggests .  but i can easily find article 84 section 1 and 2 in the constitution  ( sr 101 )  ,  which clearly and directly say the alps will be protected from traffic pollution ,  and that traffic passing through switzerland over the alps will be put on railways ,  except for when it outright can ' t be done at all and there has to be a law regulating even that .  the alpine exchange is not a problem with the constitution ,  but in fact a constitutional mandate .  and we voted that in quite recently ! 
__label__0 in the us we have had major problems with vote fraud involving the electronic voting machines ,  particularly the diebold machines ,  which leave no traceable paper trail to follow . 
__label__0 wegelin did the most brilliant move by washing its hands of american clients and america .  they removed a yoke which would only lead to decay and destabilization of banking . 
__label__0 i find swiss ,  austrian and german niederdeutsch harsh .  hochdeutsch is mild in comparison to aforementioned dialects .  swiss lingo falls hard on my ears .  and without standardisation the language falls apart .  .  .  and one day people living in the same country won ' t be able to understand each other . 
__label__0 i am a linguistics student studying in istanbul .  i valorise linguistic variation a lot - every one may have their own idiom while also they are good at a standardised form of language in order to be able communicate generally .  i myself love swiss german - even better than standard german .  methinks that linguistic variation should not be abandoned no matter what ,  as long as there are enthusiasts trying to preserve them . i don ' t know ,  perhaps i don ' t think "logically" just because i am especially in love with "bastard" languages but anyway ,  i know that i ' d support multilingualism as long as i ' m alive !  switzerland has always seemed to me to be a "linguistic haven" and i hope that it keeps to be so . 
__label__0 other countries  ' solved '  the "language problem" by oppressing the smaller ones .  so today those languages are even in their historical areas miniority languages .  in france everybody supporting the minority languages is almost considered to be a separatist .  british governments have deliberately neglected welsh ,  scots gaelic ,  irish for ages .  in my county frisian is officially recognized as a minority language ,  but the government does not do enough to protect it .  so linguistically switzerland is a much more civilized country . 
__label__0 tilmann purwins ,  you are right ,  swiss speak slowly .  i prefer the "sounding like farmers" .  when germans talk in a normal conversation they sound rather angry and seem to be about to hit each other any minute .  the ending "li" means small .  indeed ,  in switzerland many things are small .  portuguese also use it frequently  ( café - cafezinho )  .  paesc: swiss  ( standard )  written german is not the same as high german  ( although it is close enough so germans can still understand it )  .  swiss prefer shorter expressions .  for example ,  we call a tram ticket "trambillet"  ( from french "billet de tram" )  whereas germans call it a "voucher to ride on a street train" .  an elevator is a "lift" versus a "wheel chair" .  a car is an "auto" versus a "personal powered cart" .  for some more unusual  ( weird )  expressions we are grateful to find an english or french translation in a good dictionary ! 
__label__0 if you fancy remaining for your lifetime in graubunden by all means please learn romansh and if you want to stay put in switzerland learn swiss german  ( at least in the cantons that support it )   .  french and italian as everyone knows are also spoken elsewhere .  .  .

__label__0 i would not bet my shirt on the ecb being poised to raise rates by more than a symbolic quarter per cent .  since the native swiss population is hardly growing ,  future demand for housing will largely depend on the immigration of highly paid employees .  apparently ,  some international companies are presently reworking their financial numbers and revising downwards their future hiring needs . 
__label__0 well said toby .  .  to add ,  people should also check what things are affordable to them now allowing for any future payments .  the ridiculous sub-prime falls is due to bankers ,  but foremost also because of people who tried to stretch themselves more than they could ever afford .  how on earth did someone think that inspite of poor credit background that he / she could buy huge villas & pay for it peacefully ?  now these guys point the blame to bankers ,  and obviously bankers point it back to them !  people loose money ,  job ,  bankers get paid more .  .  .  i guess in swiss the main pressure should be on the renting agencies to keep rents in check .  guess this aspect is not stressed much .  once it happens  ( if ever )  then demand for buying also will go down .  but since these 2 things are gauged on very different measurement scales .  .  just my 2cents . 
__label__0 what bothers me about the swiss banks / u . s .  tax authorities issue is that the  ' little guys '  ,  swiss expats living in the u . s .  who may receive small avs payments to their equally small swiss bank accounts ,  are made to suffer for problems caused by multi million accounts trying to hide from the tax man .  there should be a distinction made .  the swiss banks are overreacting . 
__label__0 dr mo ,  you have got a point .  it should be "plus" not "instead" .  in my days ,  we had only one hour a week of sports and enough math .  but there were fewer distractions like tv ,  i-phones ,  play stations and video games .  so ,  we found enough time to play football or badminton and run about in a close-by forest . 
__label__0 now there ' s a surprise ,  the greens and the eco loonies jumping straight on the anti nuclear bandwagon with the predictable scare mongering
__label__1 just wondering  ( not for the first time )  how you select the links associated with your articles .  how come you include link to those "representing the people and organisations of the global nuclear profession" and to those "disposing safely of radioactive waste in switzerland" but not to the many organisations critical of nuclear energy ,  such as nein-zu-neuen-akw . ch /  oder greenpeace schweiz ? 
__label__0 that is very sad i srry
__label__0 the people of switzerland has the right to choose what is best solution for the country .  it is also a very good opportunity for a small nation to lead and show the rest of the world that humanity today need not rely any longer on high risk forms of energy sources ,  when safer alternatives are available today and a transformation to safer and truly environmentally clean  ( no nuclear waste )  energy sources is not only possible but economically sustainable . 
__label__0 anyone ever heard of solar energy ?  ?  ?  i understand that austria doesn ' t have a single nuclear energy plant .  if they can do it ,  why not the rest ? 
__label__0 there is no such thing as safe nuclear energy .  someday the terrorists will realize what easy targets nuclear power plants are .  they are weapons of mass destruction just waiting to happen .  no company has the right to put millions of people at such a high risk .  we will all pay for the possible higher prices and would much rather do so than to pay with our health or even lives .  time to re-think the energy future . 
__label__0 let ' s hope these merciless killers go bankrupt and starve to death . 
__label__0 after gaddafi falls ,  and is on trial in the hague ,  then the italians should protest and throw out their government .  the new government will start treating the good italians like citizens ,  not like sex slaves . 
__label__1 i ' m a little confused .  perhaps the swiss elite / politicians / academics are out of touch with the swiss middle class .  but ,  it seems to me that the swiss middle class don ' t want foreigners here and are moving to the swiss peoples party of blocker .  if i were head of an expanding asian company why would i want to set up business in an environment where the people don ' t respect people of color ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  the swiss must stop talking out of two sides of their mouths .  .  .  .  we want rich people of color and companies from developing economies to set up businesses here but we don ' t want and people of color to locate here and have any influence on the culture .  .  .  .  what the f .  .  . ck !  !  !  ! 
__label__0 yet another democratic quest of the rich west civilization .  securing contracts for rebuilding countries their weapons flattened .  as someone said “the word war iii – one country at the time”
__label__0 gaddfi is not smart  ,  i am from libya and libyans they know this man who played enough with the libyan money .  how could be smart  ?  why be is smart ?  what did he do after 42years  ?  simply his killing his people  !  we agree for any support from any country to help us to remove this crazy old man from our country .  non of the arabic counties is supporting him but what you hear in some county about him ,  it ' s because they are afraid that same thing will happen in the rest of the arabic cow tries  .  gaddafi took our freedom  ,  we will fight him to the end because if we don ' t kill him he will kill the rest of us .  the end will show the world how stupid he was . 
__label__0 “using” women less fortunate for themselves for their own gain"- who doesn ' t own products made in 3rd world countries produced by people less fortunate or child labour ?  whilst surrogate babies can ' t be compared to a product ,  the hypocrisy can ' t be lost on this statement .  women do have the right to decide what they do with their own bodies .  altruistic or commercial surrogacy is not slave labour .  adoption is often not an option either for people who have spent many years trying to achieve a pregnancy only to find they are too old to meet adoption criteria .  a reputable clinic ,  which this one in georgia is obviously not ,  permits surrogacy only for couples with a genetic link ,  either through the father or mother or both .  georgia ' s surrogacy laws require the genetic link and that a couple are married .  rogue agencies like this one who operate outside of the law give all clinics offering surrogacy a bad name .  a woman of 45 who was not able to have her own children should be denied the possibility of parenting ?  do we apply the same rule to transplants ?  medical cures ?  more often than not it is the people who have not had fertility issues themselves who feel they have the right to judge .  this article should focus more blame on the swiss embassy who issued travel documents for a baby not genetically related to this woman and an agency operating illegally and without ethics . 
__label__1 if i have chance i like to take care som eldrly people .  no matte which illness the have
__label__0 the high salaries paid to top executives is disgusting .  nobody needs that much money .  there should be an upper limit placed on salaries and the difference paid to those at the bottom of the ladder .  perhaps one of these executives can explain to me what they do to earn so much money .  ditto for professional sports people . 
__label__0 i have been fortunate enough to have lived in switzerland  ( morges ,  vaud )  for 3 years now .  i love the no noise rule that makes sundays quiet ,  the fact that life is ordered and calm - it works .  so what if shops are not open late or on sundays ?  i have yet to encounter a rule or regulation that is not bound in logic and common sense and fairness to everyone .  sundays can be family days - no rushing round shopping ,  gardening - it is far more pleasant and enjoyable .  to those who complain about living and working here ,  i would suggest you return to the unruly ,  uncivilised ,  uncouth ,  dirty uk .  if you cannot or will not appreciate switzerland and how wonderful it is to live here ,  if you do not want to integrate ,  if you cannot cope without late night and sunday opening and worst of all ,  expect it to be like the uk ,  then you do not deserve to live here and will certainly be no lossto swiss society . 
__label__0 since i got here from the uk 10 years ago ,  i have had 2 bicycles ,  2 wallets and one car stolen ,  plus my home burgled once .  the neighbours blame johanny foreigner .  switzerland is just like home ! 
__label__1 @ef switzerland is predominantly middle class and proud of it .  the "educated affluent" foreigners can set shop anywhere in the world .  no one is forcing them to come to boring switzerland .  if binge drinking ,  football hooliganism ,  teenage pregnancies and choreographed weddings of dysfunctional families etc .  are your idea of fun you know where to go .  you are wasting your time in switzerland . 
__label__0 come on vera gottlieb !  by now every single reader of swissinfo knows that you are scared of nuclear energy .  repeating the same comment over and over again is as boring viewing the same commercial on tv all the time .  many readers have already shared your concerns .  however ,  until a viable alternative is found ,  we have to live with it and make sure that our governments increase the safety measures . 
__label__0 @cj coates ,  australia in japan the loyal citizens have volunteered to undertake the most dangerous of the cleanup .  you see every society has a small percentage of those willing to give complete sacrifice for their country regardless the reason the problem exists .  i ' m sure you agree ,  digger .  scott
__label__0 @tab: "i admire the swiss way of not being globally political - well ,  until it has something to do with cash . " what on earth does that mean ?  examples ?  i recall switzerland recently *paying* over a billion francs into an eastern europe development fund as part of the bilateral agreements with the eu .  of course ,  all nations on earth act in their own best interest - switzerland is no exception ,  nor should it be .  as for your parting shot ,  i will fire back that just because something is "alternative" does not automatically imply it is superior .  after centuries of existence as a small country in the midst of turbulent ,  hegemonic and bloody monarchies ,  the swiss have learned a thing or two about existence and protection .  when you come to a fence ,  there is a reason why it is there and you should think twice before knocking it down . 
__label__0 some readers seem to be confused by the term “swiss neutrality” .  it has been defined in several stages by the lawmaker  ( parliament )  and occasionally lead to heated debates .  the respective federal laws are compliant with international treaties like the congress of vienna ,  the convention of the hague and the uno .  there are some transcriptions of such debates on the official web site of the confederation .  sorry folks ,  you may have to use an on-line translator from french to english .  essentially ,  it boils down to this: switzerland may not participate in war actions abroad either with the delivery of offensive material or army personnel .  since reference was made to libya ,  it is useful to remember that gaddafi has delivered a verbal declaration of war to switzerland in front of the uno assembly and our country is a voting member of the latter .  there is a common expression saying: “the enemy of your enemy is probably your friend” .  therefore ,  our vote in favor of the united nations’ decision to support the opponents of the gaddafi regime makes a lot of sense .

__label__1 how funny for shimon peres to talk about "science" playing a role in the development of places where the law of gravity cannot even be discussed ,  because it would be "blasphemous" to talk about something implying that allah ' s allegedly unlimited power could be restrained by physics  ( a google search for "is gravity shirk ? " produces links to an essay where this is discussed in depth .  )  it would have been more "realistic" for him and calmy-rey to have discussed how to turn the sahara into an eastern amazon rainforest ,  or how to make the great pyramids float in the air ,  than to talk about that . 
__label__0 @guido .  i ' m on your side .  more rules will only exacerbate the problems .  i didn ' t do much of this stuff as a kid because i had loads of interesting things to do outside of school and grownups around me who encouraged me to be passionate about something  ( they didn ' t always tell me what it should be and supported my goals so long as they were reasonable )  .  furthermore ,  like many of my friends ,  i had a part-time job  ( first as a babysitter and later as an assistant at my local library )  .  many adolescents had part-time jobs to start the process of developing work skills and responsibility .  why not have a youth jobs program ?  also ,  why aren ' t the schools or communities involved in providing after school access to arts ,  music ,  and other social and cultural events that adolescents find interesting ?  too many parents are caught up in their own problems  ( work ,  social pressures ,  etc )  to care much about their bored teens .  they just want the kids to conform and do as they are told .  well ,  kids aren ' t stupid .  they will find outside sources of stimulation if their parents are too disengaged . 
__label__1 i receive a reply from central govt under secretary asha sota on 17 / 03 / 2011 . she is directed to foroward the pitition to the chief secretary of west bengal . chief secretary is a part of this corrupt govt . so why she request me to make correspondence with chief secretary and why she mention that the matter does not come under the administrative ambit of her dept . why w . b police do not arrest tantrik of tarapit , satyajit , sona da , subash moira , n . k gupta , kamal marik , arabinda jana , politicians , judges , advocates ? why ? 
__label__0  ' god helps those who help themselves '  .  why not take steps to educate the population needed for the hi-tech jobs ,  pay a decent wage for lo-tech jobs ,  stop the rip-offs ,  limit and control immigration .  switzerland klein aber fein . 
__label__1 you can trust fundamentalists to voice their moronic comments  .  .  .  so this article is about the losing influence of  ( organised )  religion in switzerland .  .  .  then the reply comes that atheist crime is 18 . 3 million percent worse .  .  .  how funny -- and after this feedback count me also in the category of atheists --- as i don not wnat to be part of the morons ---- ooh and by the way mr .  ah reponsible for killing the jews was catholic and now this is a proven historical fact---
__label__0 the church is subsidized by the government .  this has weakened the church over time and made it subject to whims of politicians .  in addition weak leadership from the clergy and "modernization" of the church does far more damage .  the church does not need "updating . " christ and his teachings are the same yesterday ,  today ,  und in ewigkeit .  young people will respect this far more than a church that bends every rule and breaks every promise to avoid hurting someones feelings .  you cannot learn or grow that way .  the people in bern have a decidedly unfriendly manner when it comes to christianity ,  they tried to remove crosses from school rooms ,  and do everything in their power to remove positive christian traditions ,  teachings and values from children and public life in general . 
__label__0 @ frank ,  united kingdom: i am sorry to inform you that the swiss army is ,  under order of the bundeshaus ,  too engaged ,  trained for and active to protect the wef participants in davos .  the  ' free for all" open swiss border and security for the swiss population is evidently of no interest or concern to the "global ,  avant-garde" swiss government leaders any longer . 
__label__0 @rene .  you are way out of line .  when was the last time you tried to learn a new language as an adult in a country where it is not easy to do so ?  swiss german is virtually out of reach as one can ' t easily study it anywhere .  even your fellow citizens complain about the difficulty involved in relocating around ch .  i think the swiss are the ones with unreasonable ,  naive expectations .  .  .  .  it is clear that you can ' t manage your immigration policies well .   .  .  the swiss are always so quick to boast about all the languages they can speak .  even my in-laws boasted about how i didn ' t have to worry because so many people speak english .  well ,  the truth is-- people don ' t or won ' t always speak english and the swiss should stop lying to the world about multilingualism and then blaming others when they get here for not mastering all these languages and dialects .  what is it with this bait-and-switch culture ?  why don ' t you just say upfront ,  you don ' t want any foreigners who can ' t pass a language test  ( but then the swiss must speak high german ,  high french ,  etc ,  okay ?  )  ?  many educated people came here based on false advertising and after getting here the swiss don ' t want any responsibility for the false advertising ! 
__label__0 thank you for your comment .  the reason english isn ' t on the list is that most doctors in switzerland speak english ,  so they can communicate directly . 
__label__1 @renee ,  deplorable ?  btw i can read ,  write and / or speak in seven different languages  ( at different levels )  ,  and you ?  but i haven ' t gotten to the chapters in the language textbooks where complicated ,  rare medicial diseases ,  conditions ,  tests ,  and medicines are described .  ooops ,  because they don ' t exist !  so my daughter should just die because i don ' t know the word for hemoglobin ?  or we should go back to .  .  . oh wait ,  we are swiss .  luckily ,  the doctors want to save the lives of everyone and not just the lives of people who are fluent enough . 
__label__0 hi ,  i just wanted to say what an amazing voice maya has ,  i actually believe that she is much better than susan boyle ,  good luck to her in the future . 
__label__0 haha ,  no i ' m sure they did not leave there wives behind .  we have a good culture ,  and good morals .  i ' m sure these young men are not yet married ,  and seeking a better life for themselves so that they may get married and have children sometime in the future .  but who knows .

__label__0 so far ,  quite less than the victims of coal . 
__label__0 and it should not be forgotton that the radiation measured within 50km of a coal-fired station is 3 times that within a 50km radius of a nuclear station !  coal ash is mildly radioactive .  that radioactivity is spread thinly over many tons of material ,  but is just as risky ,  and far less controlled .  in short ,  all forms of energy involve risk .  but do you wish to return to the stone-age ?  i thought not .  rs

__label__0 @toby - i am a foreigner and was simply asking an innocent question . 
__label__0 for those of you foreigners that want to have kids in switzerland ,  there is another law you need to be aware of .  for the childs birth certificate ,  one has to get a "newly issued birth certificate of the foreign born parent" .  if your country did not maintain official records or is a non-existing country now ,  then you may experience that your swiss-born child has no "identity" .  believe it or not - your passport is not accepted for this purpose .  nor is a certified / aposteled copy of the original birth certificate .  so ,  if you are going to get married in a foreign country ,  make sure you have cleared up with the local gemeinde all the paperwork you will need for the marriage license to be accepted in ch .  eg - apostle process as well as make sure you have verified the local consulate admin charges for paperwork verification .  this may cost 1000 ' s  ( it did in the case of a friends childs birth registration )  .  btw - i "admire"  ( sarcasm )  this new law .  another example of how the right wing is sticking it to the non-eu gentry .  this law also affects white people from canada ,  us and australia .  so ,  as much as it is designed to keep africans and asians from entering ,  it also hurts some misfortunate white people as well . 
__label__0 instead of bleating about how hot and dry it has been how about telling us the meteorological reasons for this unusual spell of weather .  was it perhaps excessive foehn winds bringing warm dry air from africa ? 
__label__0 it is a common held view that going to the solarium cuases cancer .  well ,  the same thing with the natural sun ,  it is about a responsible use .  without sun light we would die .  in winter time ,  using the solarum 1 or 2 times a week for 5 to 10 minutes even improves health condition and reduces depressions .  other example: drinking too much water would destroy the kidney ,  though water is essential for being alife .

__label__0 it should be quite easy to accommodate this growth with some political will .  we should be just as capable to build many houses and infrastructure as many bunkers .  .  .  it will however take a lot of political will to dampen the effect on lower income earners .  and i think the amount of housing required will be greater than the increase of the population ,  after all ,  many younger people from more rural areas want to move to the comfort and jobs in the cities .  .  . 
__label__0 has anybody in the government thought to devise some mean to limit population growth  ,  immigration and therefore avoid all these housing projects that will finally destroy the whole country  ? 
__label__0 @mark i agree that we are not perfect ,  but which other country should lead the human rights cause down the right path ?  china ?  russia ?  iran ?  syria ?

__label__1 switzerland is being a cry baby as usual .  they barely received 150 refugees and now supposedly all hell is loose .  when at the same time tunisia ,  a much poorer country ,  is dealing with tens of thousands of refugees from libya .  i wish the swiss had been equally concerned when the former tunisian dictator and his entourage were parking their embezzled billions in switzerland .  .  .  democracy in the arab world is something that should be supported due to its great long term economic and security upside .  if that means temporarily taking in a few refugees then so be it .  oh yeah ,  the article also said that switzerland had earmarked 12 million francs for the whole of north africa ,  gee i really hope they did not break the countries bank for that .  let ' s remember that switzerland to my knowledge is the only country where muslim citizens are not allowed to build proper mosques ,  the mosques in switzerland are not to have minarets  ( towers )  ,  as they could optically compete with church towers .  the same arrogant attitude switzerland’s eu neighbors are accustomed to ,  is once again showing with regards to tunisia ,  a country which has always been friendly and open to the west .  why should anyone be surprised after all ,  were the swiss not quick to declare “das boot ist voll”  ( the boat is full )  when jewish refugees tried to escape nazi germany through the swiss border ?  why is it that switzerland is always really quick at cherry picking economic perks all over the world ,  but somehow has a big problem with the word solidarity ?

__label__0 unless i am not following correctly ,  this evidences the swiss sense .  the uk banks fell apart to a much more devastating effect yet only recently suggested a weak increase to 9 or 10% equity held by the banks .  the swiss banks did badly but sailed through comparatively speaking but they still look to put it up to 19% .  fantastic and sensible country who are proactive rather than reactive

__label__0 i have no sympathy with imported minority sports in ch having their own grounds .  to start off with ,  there is little enough flat land here and what there is is being devoured for expensive ,  ugly apartments so that people can live on their own .  secondly ,  switzerland is already suffering because there are too many sports being played here .  ex-pats who wish to integrate should take up the sports like hockey ,  football and winter-sports .  support the local infrastructure .  do what the swiss do .  don ' t create more reasons to make yourselves different from the local people .  i am angered when i see golf-courses here .  it is a waste of perfectly good ,  valuable land that could be used for agriculture .  and all for a very small number of people .  if you want to play golf ,  fly off to scotland or ireland for an abundance of good quality courses .  and finally ,  there were no cricket grounds nearby where i grew up .  if we wanted to play cricket or rounders or anything else ,  we went up to the field nearby and played there .  i see no reason that people can ' t play these sports in public spaces ,  if they want to play them . 
__label__1 how about a goldstone-type enquiry into syria ' s brutality against its unarmed civilians ?  oh ,  i forgot .  .  .  . it ' s the thug states that run the show at the un ,  which is why there will be no "goldstone report" into the slaughter of some 40 , 000 civilians in sri lanka in the brutal government put down there ,  the un announced .  only israel has the dubious distinction of being the only country for "permanent review" status at the un ,  for the "crime" of defending itself agaist genocide .  no prizes for guessing why . 
__label__1  '  ' israeli leaders rejected the deal ,  .  .  .  .  . ruling out negotiations with any palestinian government that includes hamas ,  considered a terror organisation by israel ,  the united states and the european union .  '  '  this is not just misleading .  it is also mendacious .  hamas is a terrorist group whose charter explicitly declares its genocidal intention to annihilate the jewish people .  secondly ,  it is fatah that consistently refuses to negotiate with israel and to recognise its right to exist as a state . 
__label__0 the pact between fatah and hamas is of course a marriage of convenience .  if such a pact were to last ,  then of course it would mean the end of mahmoud abbas and the economic and social progress that has been made in ramallah and environs . 
__label__1 the idea that genocidal fanatics+genocidal pragmatists=jeffersonian democrats and peace in our time in the middle east is merely the morally debauched anti-reasoning which passes for educated opinion in the west . 
__label__0 hamas does not recognise israel or its right to exist .  this is something which does not seem to be heard .  peace can never be attained without the acceptance of another . 
__label__0 if bin laden was the "master mind" behind 9 / 11 ,  how come he was never on the fbi ' s most wanted list ?  ?  ?  was he killed now or a few years ago - keeping the lie alive in order to justify the us '  fictitious "war on terror" ?  after all ,  we know now that north vietnam never carried out the attack in the gulf of tonkin .  pure us fabrication to justify the vietnam war .  and so it is with 9 / 11: inside job to justify us '  attacking at will any country around the world .  so who really are the terrorists ?  ?  ?

__label__0 great story .  .  .  .  .  always enjoy reading about the mountaineers .  i had to give my dad to his beloved mountains when him and his friends were swept away by an avalanche in 1978 in the alpstein
__label__0 first - steck did it in the official winter season without protection - arnold did it out of season with ropes .  second - the heckmair route on the diagram is complete nonsense and misses out both of the infamous named traverses and the white spider - really incredible oversight particularly given harrer ' s clear description in the book of the same name ,  not to mention the route shown correctly on any post card bought within 100 miles of the face !  heckmair could never have climbed that without the seige tactics some 25 tears later by harlin ,  who ' s direct route is also badly illustrated . 
__label__0 the swiss government must take action on money laundering cases ,  especially that related to terrorist financing and corruption .  it must be severely punishment . 
__label__1 don ' t be fooled by these roma beggars .  the bbc recently did an investigation into the roma beggars in london .  they followed some of them home and found that they lived in a nice house with a bmw x5 parked outside .  they have gangs of children putting on an act of poverty .  when the bbc confronted them in romania they just got violence and threats back .  the neighbourhood they lived in was very well off too !  for them begging is big business .  they are well organised criminals !  then they wonder why society shuns them !  don ' t let it happen in switzerland too ! 
__label__0 earning through work also mean by frauduent banking ,  sale of cigarettes ,  production of useless shortlived crap and so on .  sometimes ,  it is better for society not to engage in any legalized crime and rather  ' steal '  from the overly affluent in order to get food .  this does not mean you should engage in organised begging exploiting children whatsoever .  but just think about the harm caused by legalized criminals to society and those caused by these poor human beings who are strangled by an aweful ,  inhuman culture . 
__label__1 leider ist folgende tatsache fast unbekannt und sich unbeachtet: die "besetzte" westbank ,  oder yehuda und shomron ,  haben nie zu einem anderen staat gehoert ,  denn auch jordanien haben diese gegend 1948 besetzt ,  und nur weil jordanien - entgegen dem guten ratschlag von israel her - 1967 in den krieg eingetreten ist ,  sind diese territorien an israel gefallen .  in jedem anderen land wuerde es heissen ,  dass die gebiete "befreit" wurden ,  nicht besetzt .  drum gibt es kein "rueckgabe" ,  sondern hoechstens ein unberechtigtes "abtreten" .  die araber  ( palaestinenser gibt es ja uch erst seit ca .  40 jahren !  )  verlangen die gebiete auch judenrein .  auch diese tatsache muesste besser beachtet werden .

__label__0 swiss german as a single language does not exist .  there is bern-german ,  zurich-german ,  basel-german ,  luzern-german ,  zug-german ,  aarau-german ,  etc ,  etc ,  etc plus all of the kantonal variations .  just one national swiss-german would make integration so much easier but if the swiss cannot integrate themselves ,  what chance have the foreigners got ? 
__label__0 in 1980 i flew my usaf t-38 over the grand canyon inverted ,  a dream for a young student pilot and a lifetime memory to brag about .  but what you have done makes my experience elementary .  you are quite an amazing pioneer ,  with a life experience shared by no one .  thank you for broadening the vision and making life an exciting adventure for those who follow you in your pursuits .  fly safe ,  and thanks !  ! 
__label__0 i feel that whether a violent ending such as throwing themselves off a bridge or an assisted one the end result is irreversible . i resent switzerland becoming a centre for people killing themselves and think without religion and all why people insist on having so much control over their lives ?  after all we can not decide our birth so why our death ?  i think it is a bad example for the younger generation to give up when things get difficult a life without suffering and pain is a shallow one living involves much pain and i fear that people who are going through emotional turmoil might abuse this possibility .  i am against suicide and against making it official .

__label__0 the expression xenophobia has become a buzzword as of late .  out of mere curiosity i browsed and found an interesting definition .  xenos means at the same time ,  stranger and guest .  phobia means intense fear  ( not hatred )  of something .  the contrary of xenophobia is philoxenia ,  meaning hospitality .  apparently ,  there is no ancient greek word for the fear of criminals .  definitions of the most common phobias are indicated .  source: skiathosbooks . 
__label__0 fascinating .  something that i had already learned intuitively ,  but wonderful to see science backing it up .  swiss german is definitely "sung"  ( polyphonic )  in a way that i find more pleasant to the ear  ( english is my mother tongue )  and a typical swiss accent speaking english is attractive to many english speakers ,  while the typical high german accent is rather dull .  can you post the link or part of the title here ? 
__label__0 if a foreigner wants to live in switzerland they  ( not only their kids )  should adapt to the local customs or in this case languages .  .  the same would apply if a swiss national would choose to live elsewhere in the world .  .  swiss german is an official language ,  it is not slang .  .  i do not see what is wrong teaching kids the local language where they live ,  it helps them integrate better .  talking about dialects look at germany are you all going to tell the germans to stop teaching their kids bayrisch for example .  .  .  .  .  i do not see why everybody always wants to change the traditions  /  customs of switzerland .  .  .  look at your own problems they are much greater .  .  once again maybe this is the time for switzerland to look at leaving the schengen zone and restricting movement and moving back to traditional values .  over the last years the us and in particular the eu has been trying to push their views on switzerland ,  they want switzerland ' s money but reprimand switzerland for everything else .  .  leave our language alone !  !  ! 
__label__0 this is not a case of teaching ebonics .  swiss german is not a slang version of high german .  it is a different language .  it is the mother tongue of most of the people growing up in the german speaking part of switzerland .  the reason why many swiss want their kids to keep speaking swiss german in kindergarten is to protect the language ,  to help ensure that it does not die out .  for example ,  my daughter routinely uses the high german word for "work" instead of the swiss german word .  for her ,  that word has died .  the national identity and cultural heritage is what many are concerned about .  being less than a perfect speaker of high german is not such an issue for swiss .  why do they need to speak this language perfectly ?  one might think that it was necessary in business situations ,  to appear more professional .  however ,  this only comes into play if a swiss is working in germany ,  or working in switzerland in a firm where the company language is not swiss german .  this is not very common .  much more common is for the language of the firm to be english ,  so the swiss are on a better footing in most cases than their german colleagues . 
__label__0 obviously ,  the last para of my previous posting should read: "having said that ,  the fact of the matter is that despite all the real or perceived imperfections of switzerland ,  the country has recently attracted a number of immigrants that is probably second to none . " sorry about the typo . 
__label__0 i believe that nuclear power is cheap and more efficient then other forms .  even though it creates radio active waste ,  fossil fuel plants create air pollution ,  and therefore the question is do you want the pollution in your lungs or in a safe place ?  until a greener and cheaper source i do not believe that closing the plants would be rational .  it is a scare from an incident .  we will never be 100% safe .  cars crash ,  trains derail ,  we will never be able to build a system that is 100% safe ,  and i believe the same goes with power .  japan shows that we need to pay more attention to the safety of the plants ,  and i do not believe that a tsunami will be hitting switzerland any time soon .  also ,  it would be silly to shut down the plants without having first built their replacements ,  as it says it accounts for about 40% of switzerland ' s energy ,  and if we shut them down now before a replacement source is found ,  people should not be surprised if their electricity bills sky rocket . 
__label__0 humble done
__label__0 communes and cantons with above average tax income have to redistribute part of it to those with lower incomes  ( federal and cantonal per-equation keys )  .  without fiscal flexibility some less attractive areas  ( landscape ,  access to transportation and jobs ,  etc .  )  would be deserted .  taxation autonomy is one of the principles of our country .  at each level they decide how much the tax brackets can be raised without losing the best payers .  revising the redistribution keys and federal tax rates would increase fairness without compromising federal autonomy .  not to forget ,  you pay a price for a lower tax rate with higher housing costs . 
__label__0 the risks do indeed need to be managed .  the need for alternatives is urgent .  the fact is thought that people today would never accept to go back to a world that precedes the age of readily available and relatively cheap energy . 
__label__0 solar energy is very impotant ,  but we are not using enough !  !  ! 
__label__0 unbelievable .  switzerland has become the laughing stock of international currency speculators .  betting on the swissie has been a free ride for the past three years and they are laughing their heads off over our government ' s inability to stem the inflow of hot money .  just read the comments on the internet and you will see what i mean .  do not blame the snb - they cannot compete with hedge funds that have very deep pockets .  the current weakness of the us$ and euro tell only half of the story .  our currency has been inflated against almost any other currency .  it would be about time for our politicians to wake up before more of our companies go broke ! 
__label__0 no ,  my friend ,  it is the politically correct lobby that paint the statements of others to apply to all foreigners  .  .  .  .  it is not the campaigns that do so .  the leftist heart-on-the-sleeve politicians use this tactic to good effect as this seems to have hit home with you and many others .  i prefer to be brutally honest .  at least there are no ambiguities .  integration is the responsibility of the foreigner .  switzerland has only to ensure the mechanisms are there to facilitate this .  demanding a minimum language ability is completely normal and should be enforced to much stricter degrees than it is now .  i know of several people in my community who have been here  (  in my commune  )  35 years and still do not speak the local language  !  !  !  !  i know they are not alone  .  .  .  there are literally thousands of them nationwide .  i just call things as they are  .  .  .  .  unfortunately ,  for the politically correct ,  the truth hurts and so they want it to be sugarcoated and all flowery  !  !  !  !  no thank you  !  !  there are already too many parallel societies in this land ,  they need to assimilate or leave . 
__label__0 i totally agree with free thinker ,  and i am an immigrant too .  even if it would cost me my swiss permit ,  i still would support what the right wing party is saying: people ,  protect your culture ,  protect your beautiful country !  please restrict the immigration .  if you really need some labor immigrants ,  do not give them any social aid ever ,  under no circumstances !  your economy will loose much more than acquire otherwise . 
__label__0 what is it that the average swiss has against foreigners ?  well ,  it isn ' t always that which the politicans say it is .  moreover ,  different sections of swiss society have different axes to grind .  we should also remember that today ' s  ' swissness '  is the product of past immigration and integration .  you ' d be surprised how many right-wing  ' anti-foreigner '  politicans stem from a 19 and 20 century immigrant background .  i can only say what rattles me - and i am just a middle-class retired professional : - they are parallel societies and special deals for foreigners .  special deals .  --------------------- why should i be a financially  ' transparent '  citizen to the tax authorities  ( i can hide no secret wealth )  while a rich foreigner can hide his financial affairs and get a tax deal .  i think that we should all be equal before the law - including tax law .  why do we  ' need '  all these foreign specialists ?  why should i have to converse with nurses ,  interns and doctors in the local hospital in high german ?  and the universities still operate a numerus clausus on medical students .  why do foreigners get tax deals that lower cost of accomodation and provide private education for their children while i have to pay full price for both ?  why must our children speak high german in kindergarten ?  why do we allow companies to import senior managers from abroad ,  when there are swiss citizens looking for those jobs ?  they bring with them suspect sets of business values that are often in conflict with the moral values of the average swiss citizen - and they call it globalisation and progress .  parallel societies ------------------------- our system of social ,  moral and legal customs is the result of the renaissance ,  the reformation ,  the enlightenment ,  the industrial revolution and the development of modern democracy .  this has resulted in a concept of human rights ,  and should not be lightly put aside .  ours is a highly tolerant society - others are not .  try building a church in riad ,  or taking your bible in your luggage on a sightseeing trip to mecca .  western civilisation has progressed slowly and consistently ,  while islam has remained rooted in the early middle age .  if we wish to preserve our human rights and provide hope for all those struggling for a modern islam we must protect our values .  foreigners must learn the local language: must accept and abide by swiss law - no exceptions: must accept the swiss way of life and adapt to it - even though it may take a generation or two .  finally ,  it should be clear that integration is the responsibility of the immigrant - not the state .

__label__0 will switzerland simply import more french nuclear electricity  ?  hopefully ,  carbon capture and sequestration can be implemented rapidly  ( this will necessitate immediate investments in research )  ,  so natural gas electricity can become near carbon-free .  with the discovery of abundant shale gas ,  this is a viable alternative to nuclear power .  combined power and heat in cities ,  together with energy recovery when burning trash and agricultural waste ,  can make the swiss near carbon neutral with respect to electricity production ,  without nuclear power .

__label__1 i appreciate the smoking ban in bars / restaurants for comfort reasons ,  but it would be honnest to state that many very serious scientists have rubbished the risk of second hand smoke  ( e . g phillipe even )  .  there are plenty arguments against second hand smoking risks .  one being that if second hand smoke exposure is a significant risk factor for developing lung cancer ,  then we should expect to see increased numbers of cancer cases in non-smokers who are exposed to regular doses of second hand smoke .  there has been no increase in the incidence of lung cancer among nonsmokers over the last 40 years .  that is a fact .  data from us national mortality studies show that rates of lung cancer among non-smoking women remained stable between the 1950’s to the 1980’s  ( very few women smoked during those years )  and didn’t rise until substantial numbers of women started smoking in more recent years .  these non-smoking women were included in numerous studies as control groups for examining lung cancer rates in their smoking spouses .  as anti-smoking logic would dictate ,  the longer one is exposed to second hand smoke the more we should see a rise in lung cancer .  however ,  when we examine the data from the studies noted above ,  we do not see such a rise in cancer rates for these non-smoking women . 
__label__1 they have created a fear that is based on nothing’’ world-renowned pulmonologist ,  president of the prestigious research institute necker for the last decade ,  professor philippe even ,  now retired ,  tells us that he’s convinced of the absence of harm from passive smoking .  a shocking interview .  what do the studies on passive smoking tell us ?  philippe even .  there are about a hundred studies on the issue .  first surprise: 40% of them claim a total absence of harmful effects of passive smoking on health .  the remaining 60% estimate that the cancer risk is multiplied by 0 . 02 for the most optimistic and by 0 . 15 for the more pessimistic … compared to a risk multiplied by 10 or 20 for active smoking !  it is therefore negligible .  clearly ,  the harm is either nonexistent ,  or it is extremely low .  it is an indisputable scientific fact .  anti-tobacco associations report 3 000-6 000 deaths per year in france  .  .  .  i am curious to know their sources .  no study has ever produced such a result .  many experts argue that passive smoking is also responsible for cardiovascular disease and other asthma attacks .  not you ?  they don’t base it on any solid scientific evidence .  take the case of cardiovascular diseases: the four main causes are obesity ,  high cholesterol ,  hypertension and diabetes .  to determine whether passive smoking is an aggravating factor ,  there should be a study on people who have none of these four symptoms .  but this was never done .  regarding chronic bronchitis ,  although the role of active smoking is undeniable ,  that of passive smoking is yet to be proven .  for asthma ,  it is indeed a contributing factor  .  .  .  but not greater than pollen !  the purpose of the ban on smoking in public places ,  however ,  was to protect non-smokers .  it was thus based on nothing ?  absolutely nothing !  the psychosis began with the publication of a report by the iarc ,  international agency for research on cancer ,  which depends on the who  ( editor ' s note: world health organization )  .  the report released in 2002 says it is now proven that passive smoking carries serious health risks ,  but without showing the evidence .  where are the data ?  what was the methodology ?  it ' s everything but a scientific approach .  it was creating fear that is not based on anything .  why would anti-tobacco organizations wave a threat that does not exist ?  the anti-smoking campaigns and higher cigarette prices having failed ,  they had to find a new way to lower the number of smokers .  by waving the threat of passive smoking ,  they found a tool that really works: social pressure .  in good faith ,  non-smokers felt in danger and started to stand up against smokers .  as a result ,  passive smoking has become a public health problem ,  paving the way for the evin law and the decree banning smoking in public places .  the cause may be good ,  but i do not think it is good to legislate on a lie .  and the worst part is that it does not work: since the entry into force of the decree ,  cigarette sales are rising again .  why not speak up earlier ?  as a civil servant ,  dean of the largest medical faculty in france ,  i was held to confidentiality .  if i had deviated from official positions ,  i would have had to pay the consequences .  today ,  i am a free man .  le parisien paris magazine  .  .  . 
__label__0 i returned to switzerland last year having been absent for 5 years .  oh how nice it was not to enter public buildings without the stench of smoke first thing in the morning .  having said that ,  if i wait for a bus there is no where i can run to escape the smoke ,  even if i tried .  .  . surely these places should also be banned  ! 
__label__0 smoking is allowed on enclosed  ( with a roof )  railway platforms .  even inside the main hall of bern railway station where travellers have to suffer the smoke from the numerous restaurants .  even in the closed passages in bern where cafes have tables where nearly every person is smoking .  how on earth is this acceptable and remotely according to the spirit of the law on "no smoking in public places" ?  !  useless enforcement of a poorly worded law . 
__label__0 as a swiss expat and former smoker ,  it is clear to me that ch is still far behind the us in terms of eliminating smoking from public life .  hopefully ,  switzerland will eventually catch up so that future generations are not forced to endure the struggle that accompanies efforts to quit this insidious and deadly habit . 
__label__0 as an ex-smoker .  smoking does not contributed in any positive way to human health so the more bans the better .  what is most irresponsible are all the buds being thrown everywhere here in switzerland  ! 
__label__0 we ' ve heard the same lamenting by hospitality businesses across australia when we went through this process years ago .  hospitality is doing very well despite ,  or maybe because of the smoking ban .  i recently spent time in ch and was surprised how backward ch is compare with aus in the fight against smoking .  at the moment aus is about to legislate the implementation of plain packaging of tobacco products ,  ie no brand name ,  logos etc .  the tobacco lobby is gearing up to fight this vehemently .  bit by bit we are ridding ourselves of this curse . 
__label__0 this is a very funny article ,  for a non-swiss reader .  as an australian ,  my understanding of "pop" musician is that it means "popular" musician .  in other words ,  a musician that ordinary people like ,  rather than a musician that the elite authorities like .  so therefore ,  the idea that people study a masters degree in "pop" music is one of those "only in switzerland !

__label__0 now jailbirds and criminals have evidently priority on research on their medical problems such as sleeplessness ,  back pain ,  anxiety ,  tuberculosis and hepatitis c and other medical issues including problems with their skin and joints ,  and difficulties breathing and with their digestion .  these "researchers" and their leadership at geneva’s university hospital have apparently some serious problems with establishing priorities ,  directions ,  emphasis and focus on their research programs .  how about starting some serious research on the health and medical problems of the working and law abiding and disabled population and citizens of switzerland that most likely have an abundance of undetected and untreated medical / health problems ,  many of the aforementioned problems even caused by violent criminal attacks and / or work stress and the environment .  has some swiss science and research completely gone astray now ?  more and more evidence that swiss citizens are now considered second if not third class in their homeland ,  overlooked and abandoned by the establishment .  sick to say the least !

__label__0 the lack of fathers '  rights in switzerland is outrageous ,  and this is one such issue of discrimination .  babies need their fathers and new mothers need their partners .  this is how it always was until the modern ,  corporate era .  anyone who thinks that "traditional fathering" involves an absentee father doesn ' t know their history .  fathers should get a reasonable amount of paid leave .  women will benefit in other ways ,  such as employers will no longer see them as less desirable to hire because of the potential they might take maternity leave .  but it is the basic needs of the baby and the right of men to parent that is at issue here .

__label__0 unfortunately doctors are now recommending male circimcision  ( usually at birth )  as a way to reduce the risk of hiv infection .  i do wonder how many of them are american and see it as normal ,  since it is so prevalent there ?  and while i agree that nature should be left intact ,  there still is a huge difference between most male circumcision - occuring in a hospital ,  under sterile conditions ,  and with pleasure still in tact  ( of course ,  only if there are no complications ,  and there often are )  and fgm being performed illegally ,  by untrained relatives ,  without sterilization or medical tools and with the purpose and end result of taking away a woman ' s sexual pleasure .  some boys and men get circumcized for medical reasons and we wouldn ' t advocate making that illegal . 
__label__0 @derek - you are right in your observation  ( by the way ,  i am from india )  .  but wait .  . if you are outsourcing just for lower costs then think again - did you actually expect that by paying something like 15 euros-an-hour you can get professionals at par with the industry here ?  the reality is well qualified workforce has its cost .  no matter where .  so look to india for resources which might be short here but keep your purse open .  @hans - i can understand your bitterness .  but are you sure that just because you have a microsoft certification it is naturally appealing to all it recruiters ?  be honest ,  are you out of job just because of offshoring ?  no industry would shoot itself in its feet .  after all ,  the greatest common is that money has to be made .  and more of it every year .

__label__0 @hugh janus: why do they have to meet in secrecy to help the world ?  i certainly have to question what the secrecy in humane and benevolent work and programs could be ?  look up the list of attendees and find any contributors to world peace or humanity .  good luck and wake up ! 
__label__1 june 8 ,  2011 at 10:02 pm http: /  / www . infowars . com / breaking-secret-bilderberg-agenda-leaked-by-mole /  alex jones and infowars . com have received inside information regarding the bilderberg agenda now unfolding in the idyllic swiss countryside .  according to afp journalist and legendary bilderberg sleuth jim tucker’s inside sources ,  the agenda now under review includes a number of critical issues at the top of the elite’s to-do list .  these breakdown as follows: the elite are concerned that the american congress may soon turn against the illegal and immoral invasion under humanitarian cover by nato and the u . s .  against the north african dictator moammar gaddafi .  as columnist patrick buchanan noted yesterday ,  congress is rising in opposition to bogus wars launched the by the executive branch in violation of the constitution .  “last week ,  house speaker john boehner had to scramble to cobble up a substitute resolution to prevent half his gop caucus from joining with democrats to denounce president obama’s war in libya as unconstitutional and to demand a total u . s .  pullout in 15 days , ” buchanan wrote .  more than a third of house republicans voted to pull out of the nato coalition attacking gaddafi’s forces ,  in essence forcing a nato withdrawal from the color revolution engineered civil war in that country .  in january ,  former oil industry pastor revealed that his inside sources said oil prices will skyrocket – a fait accompli with gas prices at the pump now at historically high levels – as the global elite work behind the scenes to take take down national economies .  williams appeared on the alex jones show to talk about new revelations that deal with the death of the dollar ,  exploding energy prices ,  and the engineered onset of order out of chaos revolution worldwide .  the elite now meeting behind closed door in the switzerland are pushing for a wider war and incalculable suffering in the middle east .  the money masters have long profited from war and mass murder .  nathan rothschild made a financial bet on napoleon at the battle of waterloo and while also funding the duke of wellington’s peninsular campaign against napoleon .  the house of rothschild financed the prussian war ,  the crimean war and the british attempt to seize the suez canal from the french and also financed the mexican war and the civil war in the u . s .  in addition to worrying about congress waking up to the libyan scam ,  the global elite is also concerned about a diverse liberty movement that has grown exponentially with the help of an open and free internet .  in response ,  the pocketed pawns in congress have introduced a raft of bills over the last few months designed to take down the internet and blunt its impact as a medium for alternative news and information .  on april 1 ,  2009 ,  the senate introduced two bills ,  endangering a free and open internet: s .  773: cybersecurity act of 2009 and s .  778 to establish a white house cybersecurity czar .  in addition ,  on september 20 ,  2010 ,  s .  3804: combating online infringement and counterfeits act  ( coica )  was introduced .  early last month ,  an especially ominous bill was introduced in the senate .  entitled preventing real online threats to economic creativity and theft of intellectual property act of 2011 ,  protect ip for short ,  this legislation would use copyright infringement as a smoke screen to take down web domains and institute rolling censorship .  on the international front ,  the european commission gave a nod toward implementing the anti-counterfeiting trade agreement  ( acta )  ,  a draconian measure that will subvert national sovereignty ,  trash net neutrality ,  consumer privacy ,  and civil liberties .  in the united states ,  the corporate media has virtually ignored acta ,  but then key players in the mockingbird media are often bilderberg attendees and privy to aspects of the agenda .  the above represent a small sampling of legislation and treaties that will be used to shut down the opposition under the cover of protecting copyright and preventing terrorism .  hyperventilating over exaggerated threats of cybersecurity ,  senator jay rockefeller mused during a congressional meeting on cyber crime and terrorism in 2009: “it really almost makes you ask the question would it have been better if we had never invented the internet . ” the globalists are not opposed to the internet ,  especially as a corporatized money-making instrument .  they are ,  however ,  opposed to an open ,  free ,  and unregulated by government internet where alternative media opposed to their globalist devices are allowed to thrive .  in addition ,  we can expect minions of the global elite who parade around as our elected representatives and appointed government officials to continue their propaganda efforts to convince the american people that the internet will be used as a terrorist weapon of mass destruction and as such needs to be tightly regulated – for our own safety ,  of course ,  and that of the children .  finally ,  the bilderbergers will work on an effort to sucker an already economically besieged american public into further fantastic debt producing bankster bailouts ,  specifically for greece ,  ireland ,  portugal ,  and other member eu nations sliding toward bankruptcy and social disruption on a monumental scale .  in late 2010 ,  the u . s .  treasury ,  now operating as a liaison between the government and the bankster owned private federal reserve ,  indicated it was ready to fork over billions more to the european black hole .  “there are obviously some severe market problems , ” said a faceless bureaucrat ,  speaking on condition of anonymity .  “in may ,  it was greece .  this is ireland and portugal .  if there is contagion that’s a huge problem for the global economy . ” as of late 2010 ,  the imf ,  whose biggest single “shareholder”  ( read: parasitical host )  is the united states ,  has committed 250 billion euros to the bankster engineered black hole .  “why should american taxpayers be on the hook because a foreign government cannot cover its debts ? ” asked rep .  ron paul ,  r-texas ,  at a house subcommittee hearing last may .  because the plan is to take down national sovereignty ,  impose drastic austerity measures ,  hold fire sales on national assets ,  consolidate wealth and power ,  and use an endless economic crisis as an excuse to usher in world government ,  a one-world currency ,  and a sprawling high-tech police state .  http: /  / www . prisonplanet . com is live streaming and broadcasting the goings on at st .  moritz switzerland at the hotel where the bilderberg group is meeting to plan their chaos

__label__0 another knee-jerk reaction by some incompetent ,  bush-league parliament members that have no clue how the energy is generated now and how and where it will be generated in he future .  has any of these parliament members yet come up with a realistic alternative power generation solution ?  of course there is another  ' blue sky '  solar power and wind power lobby at work in the bundeshaus to satisfy their believes and thinking that they have all the answers . 
__label__0 i appreciate my swiss brothers and sisters calling attention to this latest example of imperial exploitation of the african continent .  the rich will have food .  i guess that is the ultimate goal .  i can ' t think of any other on their behalf .  it certainly isn ' t their love of the land or the people . 
__label__0 governments have demonstrated time and again to be pathetic failures in anything they do ,  and energy is no exception .  the concept that anything "strategic" should be managed by government bureaucrats only leads to resource misallocation ,  rising prices ,  scarcity and inefficiency .  energy production should be left to the market and then prices will fall ,  like anything else that is not regulated by government .  switzerland ,  as the rest of the occident ,  is directed towards economic decline if energy production is not left to the market ,  and if the market is not relieved by the heavy burden of state regulations .  energy scarcity and high cost is the direct result of government interference . 
__label__0 the fundamental question we should ask ourselves ,  before pointing fingers to institutions and countries ,  is who benefits from these new tax deals or any sort of "deals" introduced by quasi-governmental institutions ?  and what environment makes such deals possible in the first place ?  usually is not the "people"  ( who have no alternative but to rely on these institutions )  that benefit ,  instead ,  it is typically the same entities that dictate the rules that reap the most advantages .  take for example the us foreign account tax compliance act  ( fatca )  mentioned in this article .  fatca is a bill that adopted in march 2010 that forces non-u . s .  banks to automatically share a vast amount of information regarding the bank dealings of their u . s .  clients .  who is benefiting now and what or who made this new act possible ?  it is clear that the u . s .  will benefit but what they fail to mention was the fact that only one person made it possible for them: bradley birkenfeld .  look behind the real story of this major tax scheme exposure which began in 2007 when bradley birkenfeld voluntarily approached the u . s .  department of justice  ( "doj" )  and began exposing this massive multi-billion dollar international tax fraud scandal .

__label__0 it seems that the thrust of my message regarding the intruder trying to sneak into the bilderberger conference has not been fully appreciated .  my point was the mounting self-conceatedness and arrogance of certain eu officials being the much greater evil than the secret bilderbergers ,  which is a different matter already commented adeqautely under the relevant swissinfo report .  by the way ,  i am neither fan ,  nor friend of all these secret clubs who apparently attempt to "install" the new world order stipulated on the one-dollar note  ( ordo novus seclorum )  . 
__label__0 there is always the swiss embassy ,  as consulates are satellites to the embassy in the country / region .  it ' s not as if swiss citizens abroad have somehow been abandoned and must travel an unreasonable distance to procure their renewed documents; nicht wahr ? 
__label__0 why ?  because you think so ?  because some men told you to think this way ?  women would be second-class citizens in the church if it weren ' t for the activism of male and female theologians and church members who changed the official teachings and position of women in the catholic church during vatican ii from 1962=65 .  the church has and does change for the better but only because its members have criticized it and demanded it and we have every right to continue to do so . 
__label__0 more social engineering from the left .  in a country that is free you don ' t have quotas to force employers to do things against their will .  as an employee you have the right to quit .  pay ,  advancement whatever has to be based on merit not some left wing social agenda .  would you vote for someone just because of their sex ?  no ,  you vote for the best candidate .  to do otherwise is foolish .  employers can hire ,  fire and pay whatever they want .  if that doesn ' t work for them they ' ll go out of business .  if it doesn ' t work for you hop into your time machine and head back to the ussr . 
__label__0 unfortunately large number of women would like to return to work but are unable due to the lack of daycare centers  ( and later ,  the fact that children come home from school for lunch and every wednesday school ends at 11:40 or so )  .  the lack of daycare centers in switzerland is not due to a lack of demand or the ability to make a profit .  permits for daycare centers are repeatedly and systematically denied by conservatibe forces who openly admit that they do not want women with children to work .  the business permit system should stop discriminating against legitimate businesses .  but paying women for a full day ' s work should have no bearing on the amount paid .  men leave their jobs for another one all the time .  so ultimately ,  the fact that women are seen as potentially leaving but men are not is just another sexist rationale that needs to die out with the dinosaurs . 
__label__0 yes ,  magnet strips are a security risk and we knew this and had alternatives for more than two decades .  they are so easy to copy ,  anyone  ( and i mean anyone !  )  with half a brain can buy the technology and do it .  and more recently filming pin entry also doesn ' t take much sophistication anymore .  now ,  almost all of the important cards in use these days are smart cards already ,  meaning they have a one of the golden chips in front .  these -unlike magnet strips- are pretty safe from getting copied in comparison ,  and they ' re seperate from the magnet strips .  banks especially should finally get rid of the magnet strips on their cards . 
__label__0 personally i cant wait to have a camera on my own car to record the dangerous drivers i regulary encounter on the highway from interlaken to lauterbrunen .  mostly delivery vans ,  in a hurry to get to lunch or make it back to the office ,  they pass very dangerously on this busy road ,  its shocking how ignorant they are to other vehicles .  yes i support speeding law increases . 
__label__0 digit ,  100% correct .  politicians and the people running any judicial system for whatever country should never meet .  "justice is justice" and "politicians are politicians" there cannot be justice with political influence especially here in the usa ,  however that is exactly what happens and it makes a complete farce of the judicial system .  all people should be judged under the same rules otherwise the system is biased . 
__label__1 @td , switzerland: what is your problem with insincerity ?  how about the insinserity of the thousands of asylum seekers of extremely questionable background or circumstances that have invaded switzerland over the past two decades and taken the liberty and freedom to pursue numerous criminal activities in the country free for all ?  take some time and research the statistics of criminal activities by foreign subjects seeking asylum in switzerland and switch off the alarm bell thereafter
__label__0 this is a good step but measures need to be taken earlier in the process .  there is no bullying / mobbing prevention program in the school systems ,  no teacher training ,  and not even an official school policy on the local level .  bullying is a huge problem here  ( like most places i suspect )  and needs to be tackled in the earliest years . 
__label__1 what is the link to the original gfs-zürich research . 
__label__0 why do people which have debt must pay switzerland more and more ?  switzerland ppl have stronger currency and their life is easier ,  why other lifes have to be bad ? 
__label__0 agree .  the lack of rigorousness of primary school education is appalling .  our daughter spends more time excersing then she does in mathematics .  she leaves school for outside religion classes and goes to a "babysitter" one hour a week while the other half of the class goes to their religion classes .  two hours every week are spent doing "handarbeit" which is bascially arts and crafts and doesn ' t prepare children for any true occupations that work with the hand .  where is the science ?  it should begin in second grade ?  history ?  geography ?  the pedagogy here is stuck in a time warp .  why haven ' t the swiss figured out that one learns math while doing science and geography and one learns reading while doing history and social studies ?  many foreign children can ' t have these gaps filled in by their parents .  i have also found that the children themselves have no idea what options are available or how the system is structured .  .  . so if the parents don ' t already know and know how to steer them in that direction ,  then they are left floundering without direction ,  without a diploma ,  and without great prospects for a career . 
__label__0 on the immigration idea ,  the problem is that switzerland is getting very little out of eu swiss merges .  the mass immigration in europe is growing rapidly with the arab spring and now we see italy swamped by tunisian and other arab citizens coming for a better life .  switzerland is for the swiss - not anyone who wants to try out a new home .  switzerland is now letting in many more immigrants due to eu agreements ,  but the immigrants are rarely european and now damage switzerland for the swiss .  as a democracy and a confederation ,  a neutral state not inside the eu ,  such a state of affairs is a betrayal of switzerland ,  it places others ahead of the swiss ,  in switzerland - their home country . 
__label__0 our household waited 26 months for a permit to buy a resort holiday apt from a swiss national under the moratorium in valais .  at the start of the waiting period we were required to pay 50% of the purchase price .  we are not allowed to live there under the building regulations .  it ' s on the rental market year round and stands empty most of the time even though it ' s with a local agency .  safe investment ?  it ' s a money pit ! 
__label__0 did anyone consider placing a big penalty on the swiss sellers ?  this could prevent the sale of such dubious transactions .  where there is a willing seller ,  there are willing buyers .  don ' t just blame foreigners ,  tell the rich swiss sellers to be fair too . 
__label__0 firstly people need to be aware of the animal rights philosophy .  it rejects genesis ,  which every one remembers says "be fruitful ,  and multiply and replenish the earth" ,  but then continues “and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea ,  and over the fowl of the air ,  and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth" .  the idea of man having dominion over the animals is not accepted by animal rights believers .  according to the animal rights concept ,  mankind ' s access to the benefits of nature is restricted to plants and minerals .  the animal rights philosophy does not allow for human beings to exploit animals - or to kill them - whatever the purpose might be .  this philosophy is based on the idea that animals experience life and that all who experience life ,  have it equally - whether they be "human animals" or not .  therefore we give animals the same rights as humans ,  we don ' t eat humans so we don ' t eat meat etc .  if we think through their philosophy and see what sort of world we will live in we end up with a human population to about 25 million vegetarians trying to fend off other animals from their food stores by none lethal means .  but animals are free to do as they please without human control ,  just letting nature take its course .  the animal rights philosophy does not encompass humanity to animals as the rest of us know it ,  no euthanasia for pets who are doomed to a long lingering death ,  but let nature take its course but of course you would not have a pet anyway ,  because that is exploiting animals .  to put this into an easily understood prospective ,  dartmoor ponies are wild animals ,  every year a hundred or more just weaned fouls are culled ,  simply because there is not enough feed to keep them from starving in the winter ,  shooting them is considered more humane than letting them starve to death ,  that is for most of us .  an animal rights solution would be to leave the ponies to die from starvation ,  a few ,  the strongest would survive ,  but the majority would die .  in the following years they would multiply ,  until another mass starvation event occurred .  that is natures way and nature is very cruel .  seals in canada number about 9 million increasing at 5% per year .  each seal consumes 5 kilos of fish per day well over a tonne a year .  if we want to eat fish then obviously we need to control the seal population ,  scientists say 4 million is a safe minimum .  the bow headed whale has a population of 5 , 000 all living in the arctic .  its a slow breeder a calf every six years .  not a lot is known about them ,  they might live for 250 years ,  they might go through the menopause at about 60 ,  but that ' s not known for sure .  they feed on plankton and are slow swimmers easy prey for a pod of killer whales .  the world wild life fund is trying to persuade the inuit to set up a refuge in isabella bay a place where they will be completely free of human activities ,  including eco tourist whale watchers ,  just allowed to get on with life undisturbed .  of course the antics of the animal rights groups on seal hunting make it very much harder to persuade the inuit to give up their territory to bow head whales .  seals where never in danger ,  stopping hunting will lead to culling ,  where at best the carcasses will be burnt ,  at worst left to rot .  pity about the bow head whale .  but thats a consequence of believing in animal rights
__label__0 seals are shot through the head with a high powered rifle mostly .  it is illegal to club a seal over one year as the initial insult .  seals have a very thin skull ,  clubbing is accepted as giving instant irreversible unselfconsciousness and therefore humane by veterinary scientists in all parts of the world ,  its their specialised subject believe them . 
__label__0 switzerland appears to have become a full service country in the death business .  you can have have your suicide assisted then your ashes are scattered amongst the alpine forests .  when are we going to see tourist package deals with a one way ticket on to the here after ? 
__label__0 well when you think about it ,  dying is not cheap !  you have hospital bills ,  home care for most elderly or terminally ill ,  then there ' s the cost of the funeral ,  which normally would run around $20k !  cremation is just a more costly alternative .  of course ,  one can also donate one ' s body to science : )  that would alleviate any burial costs or environmental damage . 
__label__0 surely the fairest tax would be on the fuel .  this punishes those cars that consume more .  it does not matter how old / new the car is ,  you pollute more you pay more . 
__label__0 great news for the swiss !  please tell the us department of defense to do the same for the us overseas voters – esp the military ,  who are being denied the right to vote by ancient technology !  william j .  kelleher ,  ph . d . 
__label__1 correct .  i hope this simple comment makes it past the ever so vigilant censorhip
__label__1 can i be in the trials please ,  im 63 i have psutermonis in my lungs and im getting sicker as nothing is working .  but if i miss out it will help others so thank you all . 
__label__0 digit - if greece was a computer ,  your method would certainly work .  shut down ,  clean all viruses and bugs and start again in safe mode .  you are right ,  the euro is in the center of the problem because overnight credit became available abundantly and at almost no cost compared to previous rates paid in drachmas .  the don ' t ask - don ' t tell method let the problem become so big . 
__label__0 this is just jealousy .  .  . why don ' t myopic people work hard and stop envying successful people ?  taxes are to fund common public works and facilities .  the rich use little of these but have to pay more .  .  . where is the fairness ?  do we think we ' re the only tax shelter in europe ?  i can already hear monaco calling for tina turner ,  michael schumacher ,  lewis hamilton and russian oligarchs .  and for all the noise ,  in the end ,  the "wise" swiss loose the little they were getting .  .  . rubbish ! 
__label__0 rich people benefit greatly from living in peaceful and orderly societies such as switzerland ,  because they don ' t have to pay for security measures and can move around freely and safely more or less like the rest of us .  if they enjoy the benefits ,  why shouldn ' t they contribute to the costs ?  staying safe and connected in low-tax or no-tax situations is much more expensive - how many famous stars live in somalia ,  and when do you expect the bilderberg club to hold its next meeting in mogadishu ?  what ' s more ,  the real change to an individual ' s life by the imposition of taxes is far less when that person is wealthier: half  ( just for argument ' s sake ) of an income of 5 , 000 a month would leave anybody struggling ,  while half of 50 , 000 just means you have to book an appointment with your accountant between the more interesting events in your calendar .  lastly ,  there ' s a simple rational argument: if you need water ,  you go to the river ,  not the desert; if governments need money ,  they should turn first to those who have it . 
__label__0 it ' s absurd that fukushima could have any impact at all on voters '  decisions in switzerland ,  since the chances that a tsunami could bring about a similar disaster on swiss soil are just about as feasible as snowstorms occurring over the sahara desert . 
__label__0  .  . what about the hundreds ,  if not thousands of swiss retirees and iv recipients whose bank accounts were suddenly closed "with compliments of ubs" - who don ' t have any relatives ,  are 80-90 years old and all of a sudden aren ' t receiving their social security payments ?  please keep in mind that there are lives of fellow swiss at stake !  some of them rely on their ahv checks on a month-to-month basis - and kept most of their savings in switzerland ,  only to be told by swiss banks they are "persona non grata" for something they are not responsible for .  .  .  how fair is that ? 
__label__0 does anyone know which banks are still accepting us customers ?  or swiss abroad customers ? 
__label__0 dear alien-congratulations on your new freedom from concentration camp amerika !  those of us left behind are tax slaves of the member banks of the federal reserve .  watch closely as the american elite tries to export  ' the system '  to the rest of the world via globalization . 
__label__0 agreed .  the rightwing so-called "christians" want to eventually see the pill made unavailable or illegal as well .  but they have no problem with insurance companies providing viagra or subsidizing spa holidays and gym memberships .  an unwanted pregnancy is a medical condition and many of us believe in a benevolent god who wouldn ' t put a soul in a fetus .  let ' s keep these religious extremes out of our private medical decisions . 
__label__0 wild baseless slander against christians .  and we are talking about public funding of abortions here ,  nothing else .  an unwanted pregnancy is exactly that ,  not a medical "condition" on a par with having a tumor .  from the hippocratic oath: " .  .  . and similarly i will not give a woman a pessary to cause an abortion . "
__label__0 dude ,  y ' can ' t even spell islam .  doesn ' t sound like y ' know what y ' re talkin about .  you go around blindly bombing innocent people from robots in the sky and then sit on some high moral pedestal preaching to the world .  get real ! 
__label__0 hey gallus ,  take that up with the employer .  that exploitation got nothing to do with the people of europe as you so wrongly point out ,  so dont try to dump them in our laps .  i only wish manufacturing stayed in europe .  unfortunately the eu will make sure not one factory stays in this region .  p . s take what you read in the press with a grain of salt ,  for all we know the guy worked 50% of a weekly shift or maybe worked 150% .  who knows ,  but on that info its pointless trying to bash the employer now is it ? 
__label__0 yes indeed  .  and i also agree to let greece into the eu was a big mistake  .  no financial help should have been given  ,  another mistake . 
__label__0 swiss leaders ?  ?  ?  wrong .  it ' s the swiss people who rejected the eu .  why don ' t you ask the politicians in the other eu countries if they would allow their countries to have a vote on eu membership today .  no chance ,  because it would be a complete embarrassment .  if it was for the sp  ( swiss socialists )  ,  switzerland would have been an eu member long ago .  i . e .  the sp still advocate joining the eu .  it ' s the swiss people and not its leaders that are to thank . 
__label__0 yes ,  stability !  !  a very important variable to attain  ' certainty '  .  so you dont see any economic differences between ch and the eu ?  ?  odd ,  its in the papers / media everyday .  how come your such an advocate of money printing ,  destruction of capital and devaluation anyways ? 
__label__0 half of zürich ' s roads are under construction and that too since a long time .  once the roads are ready the traffic congestion should ease a bit . 
__label__0 i find the article about "europe ' s most congested city" ridiculous and completely false .  has the driver visited rome or another major italian city ?  to give priority to pedestrians and providing as an alternative to cars one of the best public transport systems in europe  ( trams ,  buses ,  sub-urban trains )  is the only answer .  to give priority to cars then look at rome ,  milano and how about los angeles ? 
__label__0 there really is no easy answer here .  the zurich civil engineering department thinks that a reduction in car ownership in the city over 10 years from 45 to 40% means people have given up driving because public transport is so good .  maybe the reason they gave up car ownership is because driving is so bad !  of course ,  zurich is a small city so to compare traffic conditions here with la or other major metropolises makes no sense .  i don ' t think the driving is so bad in the city outside rush hours .  clearly there are ways to improve traffice flow here .  intelligent lights make sense .  allowing right turns on red lights  ( as done in california )  in many cases can also make a difference .  the anti-car people writing here need to realise too: not every trip is the same .  i live just outside the city and walk / bus to work in the city center .  i prefer this even though it is not always faster for me .  but to go food shopping without a car for me would be such a pain in the neck: a much longer trip ,  plus an impossible load to carry the 500 meter distance from home to bus stop .  i already shop for food almost every day ,  so it isn ' t a problem of frequency / load size .  some trips are convenient with public ,  some aren ' t .  not everyone can afford the luxury of hating cars or refusing to use them .  i look forward to a better future without them but until then .  .  . 
__label__0 simon ,  i tend to agree with you .  although the idea of voting directly for a minister is appealing the citizens often will know no more about the candidates than what they hear and see in the media .  the present system is acceptable .  however ,  the parties that nominate and ultimately elect the members of our government should place more emphasis on the competencies of the candidates .  sometimes ,  you get the impression that a person is selected mainly because he / she is a good buddy . 
__label__1 the 9 / 11 truth is out on the internet .  this is the truth: the wtc was destroyed by 3 underground thermo-nuclear explosions .  they were detonated by the us government which used this as an excuse to lead the us and its allies into invading afghanistan and iraq .  all these wars and deaths were based on a lie .  goebbels: “if you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it ,  people will eventually come to believe it . ” will you help to tell the truth to the world ?  http: /  / www . mathaba . net / news /  ? x=625926 http: /  / www . 911-truth . net /  be sure to watch the 26 part video there .  #4 is on the built-in nuclear demolition scheme of the wtc http: /  / www . 911-truth . net / 911_wtc_nuclear_demolition_dimitri_khalezov_part04 . mp4 #14 in on building 7 ,  which collapsed even though no plane hit it .  http: /  / www . 911-truth . net / 911_wtc_nuclear_demolition_dimitri_khalezov_part14 . mp4 #24 / 25 is on the chronic radiation sickness of the wtc responders http: /  / www . 911-truth . net / 911_wtc_nuclear_demolition_dimitri_khalezov_part24 . mp4 http: /  / www . 911-truth . net / 911_wtc_nuclear_demolition_dimitri_khalezov_part25 . mp4 http: /  / www . youtube . com / watch ? v=snh1isb20tw&feature=player_embedded http: /  / careandwashingofthebrain . blogspot . com / 2011 / 05 / 911-comparing-building-implosions . html http: /  / www . veteranstoday . com / 2011 / 07 / 11 / inside-job-more-proof-of-911-duplicity /

__label__0 why is there always such a strong reaction when israel is in the news ?  it’s because the world has enough of israel’s hypocrisy .  israel condemns the undemocratic and suppressive regimes of its arab neighbours ,  but engages itself in heavy-handed and brutal suppression of any opposition ,  as demonstrated again and again .  israel accuses its neighbours of terrorism ,  but always has been engaging in state-sponsored terrorism even before the state of israel was proclaimed .  israel demands that the arab world acknowledges israel’s right to exist ,  but it denies the very same to the palestinians on equal terms .  it blatantly ignores un resolution 242  ( withdrawal of israel armed forces from illegally occupied territories )  but calls its neighbours ‘rouge states’ .  the jewish lobby and media propaganda  ( supported by the usa )  constantly reminds the world of the terrible suffering by the jewish people some 70 years ago ,  but at the same time ,  inflicts so much suffering upon the palestinian people ever since they were disowned to create the state of israel .  the price israel has to pay for this is that it will never be able to live in peace . 
__label__0 deportees are not animals ,  even animals get good transportation and humane treatment .  its a shame that nigeria ,  nigerian high commission or embassy do not treat its citizens with respect so what do you expect from others ?   (  .  .  ) 
__label__0 "guests" ?  those are your countrymen ,  your fellow citizens . 
__label__0 it ' s about time that "swissinfo" is putting this issue on the backburner .  case closed ! 
__label__0 sociology is the study of people in social groups .  there has long been a fractured approach to studying people that has inhibited progress in each social science .  psychology ,  economics ,  political science ,  etc are subsets of sociology .  sociology must begin with physics and integrate from chemistry ,  biology ,  ecology ,  and include from earth sciences . 
__label__1 kdg ,  obviously know nothing about islam ,  because if you did you would know that islam already has all the answers and therefore must be obeyed ,  there is no negotiating ,  you either submit or else !  i suggest you also take a trip around europe and go to the islamic ghettos .  .  . if you manage to walk out in one piece ,  i would be interested to hear what you think .  i say this because i think that before you go around trumpeting the virtues of islam it may be wise to take a good look at the downside of this ideaology and give it equal weighting in your analysis . 
__label__0 excellent comment  (  .  .  .  ) 
__label__1  ' oven the populace '  ?  it ' s clear who are the first buns to be baked in your oven ,  but let ' s just remember that once the ovens are hot ,  we ' re all potential soap and lampshades . 
__label__0 and don ' t forget the movements for democracy ,  civil rights ,  women ' s rights ,  and human rights . 
__label__0 it is indeed quite complicated .  have a look at our “davis cup guide” on the right .   
__label__0 it is indeed a great idea ,  it seems to work ,  and the benefits are numerous .  but ,  like with many other things there is a hidden aspect which is not expressed here .  i visited an aquaponics system in waedenswil ' s hochschule to get to know in detail how this system works .  as far as vegetables ,  the choice is not immense ,  but nevertheless valuable .  the machinery to run it is relatively simple ,  apart from some instrumentation to measure ph and nitrogen values which were relatively dear .  there ' s only one problem that advocates of sustainability will stumble upon and possibly try to hide at all costs: the fodder .  you see ,  you have to feed the fish someway ,  so that their wastes are fed into a system where bacteria process ammonia into nitrite and then into nitrate ,  which is what plants long for .  these tropical thalia fish are predators ,  which means they eat not only plancton but other fish .  so i learned that in order to get the system working these fish need to eat other fish ,  and i was shown that they use fish pallets coming from god knows where ,  which consisted basically of all the industrial fishing operations '  wastes .  these pallets are the result of distructive fishing methods and are all the same transported and processed from several different sides of the world !  !  !  now you may consider deeply this soilless system and see to it if is sustainable as it appears to be ! 
__label__0 well ,  apparently there ' s a scientific reason for choosing a tropical and predator fish ,  namely ,  the quality of its wastes .  you see ,  i was so intrigued that i asked scientists the reason of their fish choice ,  and they explained that if you use mild ,   ' vegetarian '  fish like trout you do not get the same results in terms of ammonia production ,  which is processed to become nitrite and then nitrate  ( essential for plant nutrition ,  albeit not enough ,  as different plants long for many other minerals found in soil )  .  apparently ,  non-carnivorous fish aren ' t suitable for aquaponics production .  it ' s sad ,  it was just like finding out the tooth fairy is made up by adults .  up to now ,  the most sustainable way to grow vegetables is the good old way ,  caring for the soil ,  all the life that thrives within it ,  the water ,  and appropriate and varied deployment of crops on a small scale .  vegetable gardens are the best thing around and most importantly ,  biologically made compost  ( it takes a year to produce from waste organic matter )  as fertilizer .  the good news ?  you can have a perfectly functioning vegetable garden even in a city !  !  !  i grow some veggies on my balcony !  if only i had a garden i ' d leave no room for a boring artificial lawn . 
__label__0 dear sir i take exception to your comment about the brits boiling to death their vegetables .  i was a chef in britain for 20 years and always had the greatest respect for its culinary expertise and vegetables .  it is so easy to knock british food and cooking  , oh i forgot to say i also spent 16 summers as a chef in switzerland  . please find another dead horse to flog other than the brits when it comes to cooking ,  you are becoming like many other countries boring in your culinary criticism of britain .  yours brett hogan
__label__1 what a moving and amazing story !  i would like to know where in south africa you got the movie from ?  ?  thanks = ) 
__label__0 true love that never paid .  am touched by the facts that you were able to reunite your daughter with her dad and your charitable work in kenya is evidence enough that you love africa . 
__label__0 gee ,  i did not realize that criticism is a smart strategy to win someone ' s cooperation .  by the way ,  does anyone know how many of the government-owned buildings in switzerland are energy-efficient ?  our own gas consumption is likely to go up as the nuke electricity generators are clicked off . 
__label__0 many of us drive through the gubrist regularly just before this kind of standstill traffic and trust me people are going the speed limit  ( or higher )  which is much to high for a tunnel .  they are changing lanes upon entering and again before leaving .  all of which contributes to accidents .  the report noted the unusually high number of deaths in swiss tunnels .  speed kills ,  a fender bender at a much lower speed does not .  the article did not specify the time of day for most of these accidents .  many countries have reduced speeds in tunnels and lower accident rates .  many countries also forbid changing lanes in tunnels and report lower accident rates .  the light studies are interesting and should be addressed ,  but wouldn ' t answer all the accidents or this problem would exist in all countries .  the swiss also drive too close to the car in front of them all the time and that will lead to crashes when one suddenly finds traffic has come to a standstill . 
__label__0 thanks federer .  you ' re helping humanity .  hoping that ' ll motivate malawian leaders to help their country too . 
__label__0 and your message to the europeans is…again exactly ?  surely not that they should follow the example of the us of a ?  ! 
__label__0 congratulations ,  to he mrs .  doris leuthard for her brilliant speech at mti .  i hope the usa will assume responsibility and develop an integral plan at long term ,  for renewable energy and public transport . climate change is a fact and there is no room for excuses .  i believe ,  nice speeches are not just informative ,  but effective .  i heard many times .  " seed the ground and you will harvest action . "
__label__1 and how about the elderly swiss citizens  ( christians )  ?  ?  do you want me to expose and state some extremely disgusting case and situation of a disabled  ( cerebral palsy ) senior swiss xxx-generation citizen that has been living in some extreme low income  ( poverty )  level ?  this in an extreme left wing city such as basel .  !  now who has priority in switzerland ?  some foreign religious cult members or swiss citizens ? 
__label__0 racism  ?  i was not talking about race at all  !  ! 
__label__0 wonder where racism features on the list ! 
__label__0 no ,  beat .  it is not the foreigners '  fault .  you could blame the authorities for the lack of appropriate urban planning .  in the geneva area the rental market was already very tight in the early 1970 ' s .  the local government  ( then majority socialist )  had put a lid on rental increases that eliminated the incentive for constructions with moderate rents .  the high-end market became more lucrative because of increasing demand by top income earners which included of course expats with very generous housing allowances .  consequently ,  property prices shot up and rents followed .  the market became so tight that many citizens moved to the neighboring canton .  eventually ,  the market has become about equally tight in the vaud .  finding a nice apartment with an affordable rent has become akin to winning a jackpot in the lottery .  the massive increase in residents is a consequence of national and international migration .  you could say the authorities did not see it coming - infrastructures  ( roads ,  parking facilities and transportation systems )  are also under-dimensioned . 
__label__0 so if they don ' t want to pay taxes .  .  . why should i ,  living in germany ,  be forced to pick up their tab ?  dismantle the eu and then each country can do as it pleases: legal or not . 
__label__0 please have a look at wikipedia ' s list of countries by external debt . greece ' s problem is not its debt ,  but its obvious incapability to pay it back ,  due to the fact that since the country was forced to join the euro ,  its industry was unable to compete .  there used to be industry covering the local needs ,  e . g .  food ,  electrical devices  ( cookers ,  fridges etc )  ,  textures and so on .  germany and other strong eurozone countries made sure that those industries closed down ,  so that their exports to greece would increase .  at some point ,  rich eu countries understood that there would neither be any cheap holidays nor cheap labor around the mediterranean anymore ,  and they were not happy enough seeing the middle class there getting stronger .  the german tax payer is not being called to pay greek taxes ,  but the 30-40% interest that the german banks put on the greek debt .  therefore ,  the german tax payers are victims of their own politicians ,  who knew from the first moment what has been going on with corruption etc within the eu ,  but that was for their own dirt profit .  if all eu countries signed for solidarity ,  that has to be provided by any means .  if germany ' s politicians decided that those means would be tax on their own people ,  then it ' s their problem to deal with it .  if greece or any other country leave the euro ,  their entire stock market will be bought by the us ,  and then commercial transactions between germany and that country will be between euro and dollar .  and as the french economy is in twice as bad risk than the german economy ,  why don ' t french people complain ?  i would assume because they have proper information ,  they know how dirty the political-financial world in every country is ,  and they understand the meaning of the word solidarity
__label__0 it seems someone is upset at the reasonable and logical remark of those hiding in friends and families basements .  typical progressive liberal mindset .  close the borders everywhere ,  period .  you want in ?  you have to apply legally and wait for approval ,  period .  illegal immigration along with radical religions will eventually destroy the world .  progressives don ' t care much about that though . 
__label__0 ha ,  let ' s first agree on the radical religions  ( southern baptists and tv-preachers included i hope ,  not just these foreign radical religions )  .  then let me say i am not upset but fed-up with those that prefer rethorics over facts ,  so my question was; is there any proof there is an increase in illegal imigrants in switzerland ?  by the way; how are those 20+million illegal mexicans doing over there  ( despite closed tightly controlled borders )  ? 
__label__0 it is very simple .  if you debase the swiss franc all imports to switzerland become more expensive and ultimately inflation will start to kick in .  us is practicing your theory and it works only because the us $ is used as the trading and reserve currency of the world .  besides this the swiss franc is used as safe haven in the currency markets in times of financial turmoil .  it will loose this status if the word goes out that snb started printing chf ' s . 
__label__0 who has the money ?  ?  banks ,  they will lend you anything ,  they will never loose ,  franc is going to 1:1 to euro in near future ,  which will bring chaos  ! 
__label__0 @ us lynx: you are confusing apples and oranges ,  there is no hypocrisy .  as everyone knows ,  alcohol *can* be consumed in small quantities that do not have a debilitating effect on the consumer .  in fact ,  there are scads of medical studies which show the health benefits of a glass or 2 of red wine per day .  it is entirely different with recreational drug use where the only goal is to become high .  and of course ,  it is a myth that the drug user is only harming himself: the rest of society ends up paying sooner or later for the consequences of his irresponsible behavior . 
__label__0 doug ,  apples and oranges indeed !  on the issue of medical studies the benefits of marijuana are many: pain management ,  antinausea ,  insomnia ,  appetite enhancement ,  treatment of als ,  arthritis ,  glaucoma to name a few .  as for irresponsible behavior ,  i doubt there are any studies on this ,  but i suspect a comparison would demonstrate a much higher rate of physical and domestic violence associated with alcohol use vs .  marijuana . 
__label__0 there are many serious medical studies that back important benefits of marijuana .  most importantly in relation to cancer therapy and appetite stimulation as well as treating nausea .  and people do smoke marijuana in small moderate amounts .  i ' ve known many people who will just have one drag from a vaporizer .  and lastly it is so obvious that too much alcohol causes you to loose control and do stupid things ,  whereas too much marijuana just makes you tired and want to sleep .  tell me ,  what are some serious effects on society from marijuana ?  what ,  laziness ?  oh no !  ! 
__label__0 andré bugnon is right .  some people simply forget to switch on their brains before they leave home .  menna ' s comment does not convince .  maybe ,  he refers to geneva .  in other cities of the romandie drivers stop and often make a hand sign when they see that pedestrians want to cross .  it is not always obvious .  sometimes they chat next to a crossing and suddenly turn around to step on the road without looking .  children are more disciplined but require more attention when they play .  bikers '  behavior often shows that they know that receiving fines is the "privilege" of car and truck drivers .

__label__0 under normal circumstances your statement is acceptable .  however knowing the fact that foreign currency loans were very much promoted  ( and local currency were less preferred with 3-4x interest rates )  by our previous government they have already faced unpleasant consequences during our last election when they ' ve seriously lost .  however the results will hit our bank customers and taxpayers and of course the current government too due to the getting more and more widespread economic crisis .  i see no other chance that converting back those loans to local currencies with the exchange rates of their original date ' s issued .  this would challenge banks with negative impacts however this would make the story end a still more reliable way .  i bet the above will not happen anyway ,  although there is a trial at court for that .  why ?  you people in switzerland know the answer .  what is important to know regarding this story is the fact ,  people didn '  get any chf amounts when they took the loan but only local currency .  the answer should be protecting the banks sector against any impact is the most important that counts .  and this shall be true under normal circumstances too .  are these months around us normal circumstances ? 
__label__0 the chf must down to solve the europe problems .  not rise it makes even more problems it ' s true .  and bankers must know that .

__label__0 heartfelt condolences to norway .  at the same time ,  it ' s a terrifying and yet sobering warning for secret services .  when something like this happens ,  it ' s their fault as well .  they must have agents tailgating potential troublemakers .  everyone who puts their beliefs  ( no matter of what kind )  above humanity is a potential troublemaker .  where ' s the big brother ?  we seem to need him .  .  . 
__label__0 mr .  bischoff is what he accuses candidates in october’s federal elections of - a tongue twister of the first order .  the law is not an educational tool .  it ' s the tool to punish who commits a crime under the law .  if they can ' t be found ,  let ' s find them .  nothing new about it .  only the internet is new .  get over it ,  untwist your tongue . 
__label__0 doug: 1 .  your sarcasm is not lost on me ,  simply wasted .  2 .  if you don’t like caricatures ,  look again at your own exhibit a  ( which can hardly demonstrate bias ,  since its main image is one created by the party whose policies it reports )  .  you can hardly complain of a lack of intelligent debate if you don’t recognize this poster as caricature .  3 .  i know of your political beliefs what you have chosen to make public – if this were not the case ,  how could i have commented on them ?  4 .  i prefer to deal with a ‘greed is good’ mentality to many another  ( including some on the left wing )  ,  since at least this can rationally recognise a threat to its own interests .  i wish we could say the same of so many svp voters .  as a case in point ,  here are three reasons why swiss citizens will suffer by a restriction on immigration: 5 .  under a restricted intake of labour ,  prices for goods and services will rise .  swiss citizens will have to pay more both for private and public sector services .  6 .  the restriction will mean that employers will have access to a smaller pool of workers ,  so they won’t always be able to hire the best .  productivity will suffer as a result ,  and this will mean either that prices will rise further ,  or that money will buy less ,  or both .  swiss citizens will have to pay more for less .  7 .  the restriction will also either decrease or obstruct the growth of the tax base by limiting the number of people paying tax .  this means that the restrictors of the intake will either have to impose higher tax rates ,  oblige swiss citizens to work until a higher retirement age ,  reduce public service provision – which includes roads ,  police ,  and provision for mountain communities – or some combination of these three .  swiss citizens will have to pay more for less . 
__label__0 in light of recent events in norway ,  i find this distrubing
__label__0 is it disturbing to you because the swiss voters aren ' t likely to think that they ought to reject swiss values because of the actions of a lone norwegian lunatic ?  i actually think it ' s good that my fellow swiss citizens can think for themselves and make well-informed decisions when they vote ,  rather than blindly follow what the far-left wing media tells them to do . 
__label__0 the attack in norway has nothing to do with right wing political parties with genuine concerns .  anders was a freemason and a zionist which debunks the theory that he was apart of any ethnic nationalist movement . 
__label__1 in your opinion it is disturbing and that is just because you are anti-swiss .  leave it to the mass immigration liberals like yourself to salivate at the chance to use the deaths of innocent people for political gain .  typical .  disgusting .

__label__0 scientific folly and the pompous intellectual elite ,  wearing wigs and high socks ,  who dont know what to do with their money .  you can see matter comes out of nothing has been determined  ,  god would allow nothing more
__label__1 heads should roll indeed !  let ' s start at the very top . 
__label__0 steffi ,  that ' s sometimes true ,  but there are many other factors in play .  sometimes it ' s a question of microbes or climate or access to a non-aggressive resources - and even when the aggression is a major factor ,  it certainly doesn ' t always work out for the aggressor .  two instances of that would be napoleon and hitler here in europe ,  but custer and the kkk also look like major losers among aggressors in us history . 
__label__0 "it certainly doesn ' t always work out for the aggressor" because of the response to it .  it didn ' t work for napoleon and hitler and custer and the kkk because of force  ( armed and otherwise )  that opposed the aggressor .  if the aggressor is armed ,  you better be armed and ready and willing to oppose him .  simon ,  i believe we agree . 
__label__0 this is an interesting situation .  first credit suisse chooses to serve global markets and chooses to create jobs in switzerland preferentially to the newly served markets .  these new jobs require the importation of workers .  adding these jobs and workers to switzerland has the initial effect of increasing housing prices and wages in switzerland .  subsequently credit suisse moves a portion of these newly created jobs as well as original jobs to lower cost locations .  as these relocated jobs are a net outflow from switzerland ,  this outflow of jobs will place permanent rather than transitory strain on the swiss unemployment agency .  it should be clear from these actions that credit swiss is acting in the best interests of shareholders and bonus recipients ,  and not in the best interests of switzerland or swiss citizens .  when credit swiss next requests the next bailout from swiss citizens and their government ,  the answer must be a resounding no ! 
__label__0 you left your caps lock on .  to answer your question ,  quite easily actually . 
__label__0 “unilateral actions will not bring peace to the region" .  what hypocrisy !  israel condemns the legitimate efforts of the palestinian people for self-determination ,  but happy engages in some unilateral action itself ,  like the blatant ignoring of un resolution 242  ( withdrawal of israel armed forces from illegally occupied territories )  ,  just to mention one example .

__label__0 no nuclear !  no dams !  those windfarms .  .  think of the birds !  mercury in eco-bulbs ! 
__label__0 extending the central banks mandate ?  that would be madness .  the central bank in itself ,  as an idea ,  is completely immoral and technically totally illegal - its legalised counterfeiting .  to give a few individuals the legal license to print money is totally crazy and only allowed because the public doesnt understand banking or money .  how can someone who has daily contact with politicians and government officials be considered independent ?  ?  from that very aspect the independence is completely lost .  how can the collapse of complete economies still not make it clear to some where the real problems lie ?  ? 
__label__0 correct me if i misunderstand you .  following your train of thoughts ,  taxes are legalized theft and banking is the art of cheating .   ( end of joke )  .  our central bank is a long-standing institution that has fulfilled its mandate reasonably well for decades .  its independence has recently become somewhat flawed because our politicians now have to figure out how to replace the dividend income that has gone up in smoke for some time .  you criticize the fact that a few individuals have the power to make monetary policy .  you would have to convince me that a hundred people would do a better job .  the real problems that go beyond the scope of the mandate given to the snb have to be solved by our government who is ultimately responsible for our economic policy .

__label__0 the snb has the ability to debase the franc to whatever level they choose .  swiss citizens looking for a store of value should consider moving their savings to physical gold ,  or if they want to be more aggressive ,  borrow francs and buy physical gold .  the snb is telegraphing that highly leveraging this play has little risk . 
__label__0 thank you switzerland for your action yesterday .  please do more and show the market that the chf will fall .  this is so important for the debt situation in europe .  look to norway for solutions as the pensions fund .  the chf har risen more than 50% since before the financial crisis .  norway has the same or even better economic situation as switzerland and why is nok so low ?  look to the norwegian pensions fund .  this is admistrated by the norwegian central bank for investments outside norway and measured in usd .  due to this the central banks buys currency for the pensions fund which weakens the currency .  for eks in july and august the pensins fund buys every day 300 mill nok for the pensios und .  this weakens nok .  switzerland with all its gold reserves could make a simiar pensios fund as a goal to weaken the currency and to hegde investments abroad and opposite .  for switzerland it could mean a lossin currency but a rise in stock or obligations .  this could stabilise the market and the chf . do not let the traders take the control of this . 
__label__1 how i can get online information derectly ? 
__label__0 there has not been a "meteoric rise of the swiss franc" ,  there has been a meteoric fall of the us dollar and euro .  the price of gold ,  real money if you will ,  unambiguously shows the swiss franc has maintained a steady value over the past 6 months .  from a historical perspective ,  initially there are currency wars ,  then trade wars ,  and lastly shooting wars .  clearly we are in a currency war ,  and hopefully our politicians will avoid the shooting war phase ,  although current activities in libya and posturing regarding iran are not encouraging .

__label__0 it is not the politicians who sit in ivory tower ,  they know the reality .  they are doing a theater to keep to their jobs .  the blame lies squarely on the people who elect them .  we are not a military ruled or dictatorship country .  when a party is bankrolled by a few rich and their opponents are on the payroll of the bankers ,  you know what to expect .  the posters of svp are a good example of scaremongering .  it is a bit of a tabloid politics .  it will win them the elections but the country will have no meaningful elections  ,  except an orgy fuelled by fear . 
__label__0 not to minimalize the seriousness of the offense ,  but breivik could very well be mentally ill .  he just may have happened to be a high-functioning schizophrenic or schizo-affective .  unfortunately ,  he was not being treated and for years was allowed to reside in his own psychosis-like reality ,  which eventually lead to such an unnecessary act of violence .  though i must also agree ,  being a high-fuctioning schizo-affective person ,  that not all mentally ill people are violent towards others ,  usually it the risk of suicide that is the greatest .  next time you walk past a homeless person mumbling to themselves please realize that the person has an untreated mental illness ,  and their symptoms are serious as a heart attack .  sadly ,  there doesn ' t seem to be enough resources in the world to treat everyone with mental illness so that they are able to lead more stable lives .

__label__0 the us was running large surpluses as recently as 2000 .  what happened was 9 / 11 and a naive neo-con us administration that thought it could change the middle east dynamic by waging two wars .  one a war of opportunity to install a democratic system into a country with three groups that hate each other and no tradition of popular rule .  another ,  a sparsely populated mountain covered desert and haven for the lawless with a proven track record for empire busting .  to make matter worse ,  huge tax cuts and artificially low interest rates pushed the economy beyond the point of reality until finally the bubble burst .  now we have two competing ,  dysfunctional ideologies hell bent on sticking to their guns ,  damn the consequences in a situation where neither has the power to push its agenda .  the republicans ,  true to their upper middle class and wealthy benefactors ,  want to maintain low taxes and a world class military at the expense of the middle and lower classes .  the democrats as usual want to soak the rich and raise taxes on job creators so they can keep a pension plan that is completely unsustainable given the aging population .  unfortunately ,  until ideology gives way to pragmatism on both sides ,  the world is stuck with this uncontrollable beast .  the only good solution is the one that makes no-one happy .  a good start would be to get the defense culture used to a mercedes-benz budget to learn to live with a ford .  the next step would be to recognize that people are living longer and if they want to retire in their 60 ' s and live to their 90 ' s they need to make a few lifestyle changes and save a few dollars on their own .  the s&p wake up call is exactly what the clowns in washington needed .  let ' s hope they answer it . 
__label__0 we appear to be observing the early stages of hyperinflation in the euro and us dollar ,  similar to germany in 1922 if you will .  at this point ,  the eurozone and the usa must help themselves ,  as all switzerland can do is watch the coming train wreck from the sidelines .  may your debts be in us dollars and euros ,  and your assets in swiss francs . 
__label__0 speculators love the swiss franc - but not so fast !  they are not willing to pay for privilege of holding it .  today ,  the franc plunged between two and three per cent when ubs advised its foreign bank depositors that excessive balances will become subject to a temporary charge .  the reason is obvious .  like any money center bank  ( mcb )  in the world ,  ubs places funds with its central bank .  because interest rates have become negative ,  the amount repaid at maturity is smaller than the initial deposit .  so far ,  the other mcb ' s have declined to comment .  they are probably busy figuring out how much they want to charge . 
__label__0 to the people who made the statement if all the euro ' s joined or used the euro .  .  . do not comprhend or understand currency ,  fiscal and monetary policies at all .  very uneducated remarks .  a universal currency is a disaster as is being proven .  what happened to logical thinking ?  oh ,  i forgot .  .  . it went the way of the progressive liberal communist- to the far left of the brain .  .  . that must explain the imbalance of thought with progressives . 
__label__0 i believe a rapidly growing group of people are withdrawing euros from italian ,  greek ,  german ,  and french banks ,  and buying swiss francs for deposit in swiss banks .  these withdrawals are causing banks to have to sell assets ,  sovereign debt ,  to raise euros for depositors .  the ecb is purchasing bonds to provide liquidity for these banks ,  and the snb is creating francs to be purchased .  without the bond purchases ,  the banks would have inadequate euros for deposit withdrawals ,  and without more francs available for purchase ,  the franc would be even higher .  some would call this a bank run with a flight from the euro .

__label__0 born to a "natural swiss" with heritage back to 1219 i am very concerned about the "pollution" of swiss nationality and identity .  switzerland is such a special place and so perfect in every way .  i have not "lived in switzerland but have visited family over 25 times .  and very proud to call myself a swiss .  i am also an american and though u . s is a wonderful country ,  it is a far cry in every way from switzerland .  when you open the borders to all nationalities ,  you severly change the makeup and integrity ,  charm ,  culture and beauty as well as the safety and security of the country .  it is a crying shame that switzerland has opened it ' s borders .  we will slowly loose the identity of the swiss culture ,  beliefs and values as time goes on .  it will become a "melting pot" of sludge over time and eventually not be recognizable as the beautiful and wonderful country it is .  my ancestors ,  including my father are rolling in their graves right now !  i am so glad i was able to spend my summers in the switzerland i remember before it is totally unrecognizable .  just look at us in the u . s .  and england and france .  they are all so polluted with all the undesirables .  after all when you have a utopia the whole decreped world will gravitate to your door for you to take care of them .  poor switzerland-my heart cries out for you !  dwight diener
__label__0 dd !  if you are worried about "polluting" the swiss nationality ,  please remember that switzerland has no resources ,  we only live on foreign money and resources .  if we attempt to close the border ,  we will live on potatoes and some milk from our cows as we will return to be farmers . 
__label__0 i would agree that switzerland is being damaged by levels of immigration currently ,  i would also agree that the uk has lost much of the heritage and culture it once had ,  and in response to the idea that closing borders would send us to a potato farming future i would agree in part - don ' t shut all doors - but we do need to limit not stop immigration on its current levels
__label__0 the number of registered swiss nationals living abroad is not insignificant .  it is ,  in fact ,  very close to the population of some swiss cantons .  seeing that each canton is represented in parliament ,  it is only fair that expatriates be represented somehow .  our country is relatively small ,  yet it is incredibly active on the international stage .  having voices from the "outside" could influence the course of swiss politics in a positive manner ,  leading to a more open-minded government .

__label__1 szwajcarska federacja związków zawodowych wyraziła rozczarowanie ,  gdyż ostania interwencja rządu jak na razie nic nie wniosła ,  jeśli chodzi o kurs franka do euro .  ich zdaniem rząd w celu rozwiązania problem z silnym frankiem powinien wprowadzić sztywny kursu minimum 1 . 40 franka do euro już teraz .  czyli potwierdza się moja wcześniejsza prognoza usztywnienia kursu franka szwajcarskiego do euro w poprzednim wpisie .  powrót do kursu w granicach 1 ,  5 chf za euro ,  do którego dążą szwajcarzy w niedługim czasie da nam kurs złotego 2 ,  77 za franka przy kursie 4 ,  16 zł za euro ,  przy kursie 4 zł za euro da nam wtedy kurs franka 2 ,  66 zł .  dzisiejszy kurs franka jest konsekwencją braku członkostwa szwajcarii w unii europejskiej .  aktualna wadą spowodowaną brakiem szwajcarii członkostwa w ue jest ogromny wzrost wartości franka szwajcarskiego .  czego skutki gospodarcze dla ich samych są bardzo odczuwalne ,  gdyż szwajcaria dla ue jest drugim największym partnerem handlowym i na odwrót ue dla szwajcarii .  dlatego powiązali franka szwajcarskiego z euro utrzymując go w bardzo wąskim paśmie wahań uśredniając go w granicach 1 ,  55 chf za euro ?  panika na rynkach spowodowała ,  że nie byli wstanie powstrzymać interwencjami na rynkach finansowych umacniania się franka szwajcarskiego względem euro .  dlatego szwajcarzy maja bardzo duże problemy przy obecnym kursie franka ,  ponieważ ceny ich produktów rośną i są mniej konkrecyjne z unią europejską .  mają też długoterminowe kontrakty z dostawcami ,  w których mają ustalony stały kurs około 1 ,  5 chf za jedno euro .  dlatego najlepszym rozwiązaniem dla szwajcarów jest wejście jej do ue wraz z przyjęciem wspólnej waluty euro .  mam nadzieje ,  że do tego dojdzie ,  bo ta decyzja dałaby dużą stabilizację dla gospodarki szwajcarskiej oraz europejskiej

__label__0 the critical determinant of democracy is whether or not the people can choose the form of government they prefer for their country or state .  anyone involved in this field will be aware that different people have different preferences concerning the “best” form of government .  even advocates of direct democracy differ over such details as whether or not there should be a constitutional court .  [it is amusing to see lawyers giving speeches arguing for the establishment of a lawyers '  oligarchy ! ] in most of the world: a )  the people are not permitted to initiate any move to choose or amend the system of government for their country without the consent of incumbent cartels of politicians ,  and in some cases incumbent judicial oligarchies; b )  incumbent cartels and oligarchies invariably refuse to permit changes that diminish their own power; and c )  the people are unable to overthrow the cartels or oligarchies because of the phenomenon of “prisoners’ dilemma” .  it is noteworthy that: a )  where people do have the freedom to choose the system of government they prefer for their country ,  they almost invariably choose direct democracy; and b )  where they have direct democracy they do not vote to abolish it ,  even though it is a straightforward matter to initiate a referendum for that purpose .  the challenge for paternalists throughout the world is therefore to answer the simple question: "why are people elsewhere denied the right to choose for themselves the form of government they prefer for their country or state ?  ?

__label__0 david ,  you are on target .  the swiss liberals and parents have abandoned children .  discipline and quality of schools and community have suffered .  i ' m amazed at how much more strict i am with my american child than swiss parents are with their children .  there has been a concerted effort to hold on to the fairy tale stories of the past about quality and safety but they are empty rhetoric .  i can ' t tell you the number of middle class swiss and foreigners who want to deny that the schools need improvement and treat me like a liar when i say my bicycle was stolen and that teenagers walk past my property at night and throw litter over my fence !  !  !  !  i felt safer in new york where people are honest and forthright about the ills that plague the city but equally forthcoming about the wonderful stories of cooperation and kindness .  here ,  everyone seems to try to believe a fairytale-- i guess it helps them to sleep at night .  but ,  largely i think the unwillingness to deal with the facts is driven by a lack of education .  stories sound great and don ' t require a questioning mind .  i ' m amused by the lack of research and published statistics on crime ,  poverty ,  inter-racial relations ,  sexism ,  etc .  the swiss seem to think if you hide the facts you can keep the fairytale .  swiss kids get away with murder and foreign kids are treated with suspicion just for existing .  every foreign parent i know engages in painstaking oversight of their children-- many are so afraid of being judged inadequate by the swiss that they overdo it .  well ,  it is often the swiss kids who are undisciplined and who behave with an air of entitlement .  it ' s time the truth got out ! 
__label__0 the renminbi ' s  ( also called yuan )  exchange rate is calculated daily by the chinese central bank based on a basket of currencies .  the same method was used for the euro ' s forerunner ,  the ecu .  exchange rates are published in terms of us dollars and a number of other currencies .  since the dollar is just one ,  albeit important ,  component of that basket ,  it is more appropriate to call this a managed float rather than a dollar peg .  a gradual appreciation of the rmb is the more likely option for the short to medium term .  a premature free float could lead to a disorderly and rapid appreciation because of international speculation .  within ten years ,  the renminbi could indeed become a world reserve currency and seriously challenge the role of the dollar .  one should not forget that china has hired the services of a few of the brightest brains on monetary policy .

__label__0 at the same time as fukushima has sensitized public and political opinion against nuclear power it has also re-awakened interest in safer nuclear power technologies because it is understood in some circles that renewable sources cannot provide a complete alternative .  the pressurized light water reactor has locked in technological thinking in the nuclear industry for too long in spite of its inherently unsafe design and extremely long lived waste products .  a molten liquid fluoride thorium reactor could operate at atmospheric pressure and generate a very small fraction of the waste produced by the uranium / plutonium fuel cycle .  it could also be designed to be walk away safe .  in the event of a power failure ,  a plug of solid fluoride ,  maintained by refrigeration ,  would melt and discharge the liquid reactor core by gravity into tanks having a non-critical configuration and the chain reaction would stop .  a solid fuelled ,  gas cooled reactor ,  based on pelletized fuel would be simpler to build and operate and can be designed to have a negative temperature coefficient and passive cooling so that it would have inherently safe operating characteristics .  its advantage is that there is no need for online fuel processing to remove neutron absorbing by-products ,  but the production of the fuel is more expensive .  germany operated a thorium fuelled pebble bed reactor for 16 , 400 hours over 4 years from 1985 to 1989 and safe behaviour under power failure was demonstrated .  the reactor was finally shut down following a radiation leak and difficulties dealing with deposits of dust in the system .  there is not at present a proven generation iv reactor design available to buy ,  but there is lots of international interest in thorium as a nuclear fuel .

__label__0 no point in having a currency so strong that swiss exports are too expensive to buy for everyone .  .  . except gold owners !  we have to live in the real world .  moreover i have been a gold and silver bull for nearly 10 years now ,  and despite forecasts of it going even much higher in price ,  i believe that if the economies around the world dive then liquidation of gold and silver assets will actually happen and drop the price significantly ,  below $1000 levels .  that is not to say that later it may go up again ,  but i think the next 2-3 years will see a massive "correction" due to these liquidations .  of course ,  there is also the precedent that the us government has already at least once banned the holding of gold in order to protect their currency ,  and i can see this likely taking place again ,  and perhaps also the eu countries possibly .

__label__0 this is perhaps a very important activity ,  and article about it .  thanks for the reporting i wish i still had the privilege of living in switzerland as i did for many years; maybe some day again . 
__label__0 welcome back to the real world .  is it not sad to note that bodgan from romania seems to be the only reader who really wants to understand what is going on in switzerland .  being the governor of the central bank or the chief of the weather forecast service does not make a big difference: it is close to impossible to make everyone happy .  some commentators criticize the snb for drawing the line in the sand against the euro that they call a “sinking ship” .  when a patient has intense fever ,  it does not make any difference whether you use a thermometer scaled in celsius or fahrenheit ,  the patient is sick all the same .  of course ,  the snb could have used any other currency or basket of currencies instead  ( like the people’s bank of china )  .  however ,  the choice makes sense for several reasons .  while the swiss franc is not subject to exchange controls ,  the yard stick has to be identifiable by everyone .  the eu is switzerland’s most important trading partner .  even if the euro should be debased by twenty per cent due to the eu’s unresolved problems and our currency follows the movement because of the limit set by the snb ,  the franc will still be overvalued by at least ten per cent .  it is obvious to anyone who has an approximate idea about monetary policy that the snb will also keep a watchful eye on the sixteen major currencies that are regularly followed by the oecd and bloomberg .  as the sad examples of new orleans and fukoshima clearly demonstrate ,  it takes a lot of time and resources to rebuild a disaster area from scratch .  switzerland is not the el dorado - it has no natural resources  ( except water that is becoming sparser )  and at least eighty per cent of the country’s wealth belongs to less than ten per cent of the population .  fears about inflation are totally overblown .  while many consumers shop across the border and many people of the active work force feel like sitting on an ejection seat ,  the risk of further overheating of the real estate market and price inflation is minimal .  of course ,  when the value of franc goes down ,  prices of imported goods go up and will show up on the inflation rate .  so what .  as long as the consumers’ disposable income does not go up ,  it is not a problem .  as winston churchill once said: “tough situations require tough measures” .  it is totally immaterial if they create a number of unhappy retirees and speculators as long as the end result serves the purpose of guaranteeing the durability of the whole nation . 
__label__0 the hand over of any private data regarding a private or public person ,  persons ,  institution is an act of violation ,  dictatorial or antidemocratic conduit .  before the ww2 any act of this type was a good pretext of closing relation or worse an act of war .  especially in this case ch has built the neutral democratic title with many acts of protection ,  banking data included .  losing such a state ch will not be ch anymore .

__label__0 all sounds very noble ,  but given that 40% of swiss power is nuclear generated there is no chance that this can be made up from so called green technologies .  furthermore when the unit cost of electricity rockets to pay for all this so called green power ,  the swiss will finally realise they have been conned .

__label__0 by now it is well known that 9 / 11 was an inside job and now the face of the real terrorist is plainly visible to all: the usa !  it sought the excuse in order to dominate the entire world and the most sought-after elements are oil ,  gas and fairly soon water .  it isn ' t about "fighting terrorism" or "bringing democracy" or "human rights" - it is about american survival at all costs .  fear is being instilled more and more in all of us in order to keep us under control but the day will come when this will backfire and the blowback will be immense .  it is hard to believe that a  ' civilized '  world has turned so brutal ,  vicious and heartless .  but then .  .  . only in america . 
__label__0 9 / 11 ,  as tragic as it was for the victims and their families ,  was a missed opportunity for america and the world .  imagine how the planet would look today had the us used the unity and cooperation of the events in lower manhattan to support research and development on energy independence ?  what if the whitehouse had been occupied by an enviromentalist rather than two major benefactors of big oil and the military industrial complex .  anti us sentiment in the middle east is not driven by envy of american values as is portrayed to the us masses ,  but rather the result of decades of support given by us and other western governments to corrupt and repressive arab dictators in the name of cheap oil . 
__label__0 roger was unlucky and he was distracted .  although it is not illegal to make gestures during a match ,  the djoker has done it again and again ,  during crucial points ,  making gestures to distract his opponents .  he must have watched too much world wrestling federation matches ,  where the wrestlers rouse the audience and create atmosphere for themselves .  many people are saddened by this loss ,  and effectively i switched off the tv and did not watch the finals anyway .  roger is a champion ,  and remained so in hearts of many .  a winner of a match or even a grand slam cannot be a true champion ,  until a certain maturity is reached .  it does not help if a gang of mafia fans follow him and jeer or taunt the opponents .  tennis is not gladiators and it seems this is lost to the younger tennis players and fans from another side of the world . 
__label__0 no doubt nadal & djokovic are also great players & it would be nice to see some new records ,  but this has nothing to do with greatness of roger .  i see him as a great player & a good person ,  so are others too .  it ' s a treat for me to see him both on court & off court .  if records is what you watch the sport for ,  then i really don ' t think you can like anyone .  .  . 
__label__0 i can follow the logic of "reconsideration" but cannot agree that it is "intelligence" .  the swiss politicians have again shot themselves in the foot by being too quick to announce the decommissioning of existing nuclear power stations .  and now they make a u-turn and said nothing is confirmed regarding new nuclear power stations .  in my world ,  that is called twisting and turning .  it is indeed laughable and yet sad .  i am all for cheap energy ,  and not risky ones like the old nuclear stations .  beef up the security and lift the safety measures ,  i will still support nuclear energies .  who says it needs to be risk and dangerous ?  it is all about balancing costs .

__label__0 james: bailing out banks is fundamentally stupid .  the glass-steagall act required for a good reason that banks may not commingle trading and other banking activities within the same entity .  unfortunately it existed only in the usa and was abolished .  banks should be obliged to contribute to a depositor insurance fund that would make bailout with taxpayer money unnecessary most of the time .  marcel ospel and company are enjoying a good time over the lacking bonus return clause . 
__label__0 new york ' s "no tolerance" policy targetted poor peoople and black youths in disproportionate numbers .  homeless people were jailed .  teens attempting to ride the subways without paying were jailed .  black people were pulled over in their cars without due cause and blacks were stopped on the streets and searched without warrants .  these methods wreaked of racism and lack of respect for due process guaranteed by the u . s .  and ny state constitutions .  it cost tens of millions of dollars to incarcerate these folks ,  many of whom stayed in jail for ten years due to "three strikes" laws .  they had no one advocating for them .  no tolerance was certainly not all about "broken windows , " it was a witch hunt .  certainly switzerland can solve its crime problem without become the police state that was guiliani ' s new york .  42nd street was cleared of sex theaters ,  not because of of the mayor ,  but by activists who created a zoning law prohibiting the licensing of these kinds of businesses from being too close together .  switzerland faces a different situation since not just xxx movie theaters are legal but so is prostitution .  the real problems for geneva are foreign criminal syndicates  ( which ny faced only in a smaller degree and which have no been eradicated )  and the alienation among swiss youth from minority backgrounds who form gangs .  i ' m happy for geneva to be tougher on crime and criminals ,  but please don ' t glorify what nyc did and be prepared to spend millions of dollars on jails and recidivism after one spends time in jail if the nyc model is truly followed .

__label__0 um sorry .  my sister lives on that particular block with her young son and they both had their rights violated when these "ravers" blasted their music ,  etc .  at all hours .  these people ,  and i use that term loosely ,  broke into the home .  they only got "permission" from the owner b / c he didn ' t want to create more of a riot and thought it would die down .  they urinated and crapped everywhere .  they broke property that was not theirs  ( really ?  is this legal ?  )  and made life for the law-abiding citizens of the block a miserable hell .  i am so sure that if the city heads or those idiots who were at the "party" would be so kind if something like this happened where they live .  i am in total shock that this could even happen .  police are there to enforce the laws of the land .  if you break the laws ,  it ' s our own fault .  my brother is a police officer so i know that it is a difficult job .  the people who most often complain about the police are the first to complain when there aren ' t any around . 
__label__0 the public transportation system is not the public square .  it should be an ad-free zone period instead of a propaganda forum for the corporate or political interests who are rich enough to afford the space .  but controversial political opinions should be given equal weight to both sides and not just allow one group to harass the public with their opinions and propaganda .  we have all paid an enormous amount of money for this excellent transportation system and we deserve a space in which we are not harassed by politics or religion  ( or coke for that matter )  .  how about some pretty plants instead ,  and leave the political discussions to more appropriate venues .  not censorship ,  just the right not to be harassed on a daily basis with propaganda .

__label__1 one way to help him is to regain those lost american clients who are more than likely unaware of the legal facts regarding american nationals .  [yes ,  on the us passport there is a reference to them] american nationals are lawful  ' non taxpayers '  and can never be confused with those who are actual statutory us taxpayers .  federal laws state this as fact: legislative intent of the 16th amendment – congressional record - shows the federal income tax was only levied upon the national government .  .  . not upon americans !  us supreme court decisions: pollock v .  farmer’s loan and trust co .  ,  157 u . s .  429  ( 1895 )  caha v .  us ,  152 u . s .  211  ( 1894 )  foley brothers ,  inc .  v .  filardo ,  336 u . s .  281  ( 1949 )  these supreme court decisions show that all federal laws are only applicable within the district of columbia ,  and rarely extend beyond that jurisdiction .  economy plumbing and heating v .  us ,  470 f2d .  585  ( 1972 )  this lower federal court declared that there are 2 groups -- us taxpayers and non taxpayers .  notice that non taxpayers are not tax cheats ,  tax evaders ,  etc .  as the irs statutes only apply toward those who are actually statutory us taxpayers .  31 usc §321  ( d )  ( 1 )  &amp; 321  ( d )  ( 2 )  - treasury department this shows that all federal income taxation is a  ' gift or bequest '  to and for the use of the us government .  no obligation !  michael l .  white ,  federal attorney ,  office of the federal register ,  national archives ,  washington ,  dc – legal opinion letter from federal agency he stated that there are no implementing regulations published in the federal register that mandate any american to file or pay a federal income tax .  26 cfr 1 . 871-1 ( a )  - if one does not derive any income that is effectively connected with the conduct of a  ' trade or business '  [defined in title 26 as the performance of the functions of a public office] in the district of columbia ,  there is no imposed federal income tax liability .  the irs will go away quickly when one who really knows what the federal laws state on taxation and those who are made liable .  many americans who were given up by ubs could have benefited as well but ubs elected to ignore this offer of assistance .  so ,  ubs will probably [based on past performance] miss this opportunity as well .  .  . or perhaps the new ceo will actually see what his contemporaries ignored .

__label__1 fundamentally i have no problem with collectors being paid for their services .  i wonder if we will see the likes of corris ag collecting signatures soon .  the main problem with this ,  is that the parties with the most money ,  namely the svp ,  are the ones most likely to be able in this activity .  that being said ,  there were a lot of referenda this year from the cash-strapped socialist party ,  so money doesn ' t seem to change that much in this case .  and finally it seems to me that money plays a greater threat to democracy in the form of campaign posters and other election material .  the svp have flooded the countryside with posters .  i ' m sure that wouldn ' t be doing this if they didn ' t feel that it would bring them an advantage .

__label__0 the elimination of the double names will make the life of our journalists a bit easier ,  especially when both are pretty long .  unfortunately ,  it will also end some rather funny combinations like “ganzoni hösli” meaning in swiss dialect “all without panties” .  if the new ruling makes feminists happy ,  it is fine with me .  in spanish speaking countries they have a more logical solution .  marriage does not change names .  in fact ,  everybody has a main  ( written first )  and a secondary name  ( written last )  .  the names of children are a combination of the main names of both parents .  thus ,  their mother’s main becomes their secondary name .  the system may seem a bit confusing in languages that use surname and last name as synonyms .  however ,  it largely reduces the number of pages to look up in the phone directory for very common names . 
__label__0 my god observer ,  what you have been observing ,  do you know anything about this group  (  .  .  .  )  you say they are looking for a free ride in switzerland ,  at least google them and go to their website ,  and read about them and agenda then talk nonsense . 
__label__1 this is a legitimate question if they are loved in iran why can ' t they take refuge in their own country ?  the fact of the matter is since the so called islamic republic of iran took power they have managed to execute over 120000 of the best and the brightest youth of iran .  the authorities will execute family members who have even visited their loved ones in ashraf .  no dissent is tolerated in iran on any level .  iran is going through what europe went through during the dark ages and renascence with the catholic church when they burned people alive for saying the world is round .  now let ' s imagine the dark ages are here and there are thousands of europeans who have stood up against the oppression by their states and want to put an end to the senseless killing .  if these people need refuge from the persecution should we give them refuge or let their respective countries kill them all .  the people in ashraf are mostly highly educated with 1 / 3 of them having higher education in us or european countries .  to give you a piece of mind the leadership of the mojahedin has been stationed in france since 1981 and not one act of wrong doing by any of it ' s members and supporters .  if there was any possibility of future terrorist activity the french would have experience it during the past 29 years . 
__label__1 observer ,  does not matter what they call you ,  you repeat the same nonsense that orca is saying . info is right and you are the one that have no clue about this group ,  their history and even switzerland and european history .  peaceful is right but when is for their own benefit ,  switzerland is as much responsible like other countries that ok ed to attack iraq and change the regime and the situation mojahein are in ,  because of this war .  they are being attacked twice by maliki  ( iranian’s poppet )  that has got to the power by us and its allies ,  right now europe is giving milliards of dollars to keep maliki in power or as they claim to help the new government ,  the government that has made its own people so miserable that people dream about saddam ,  yeh you guys went there ,  turned the country upside down ,  thousand died and now iraq is one of the most corrupted countries in the world ,  many secret prisons all over iraq ,  torture and assassination are a daily ritual ,  thanks to you guys .  mojahedin that have been iranian political self efficient dissidents ,  living there for last 26 years ,  peacefully ,   ( for your info ,  they are the most educated and peaceful seeking people ,  that’s why they are the opposition to this mullahs .  they are the one that saved you and people like you by exposing mullah’s nuclear program or one day you would wake up to a nuclear war )  right now being attacked twice ,  50 killed and thousands being injured ,  maliki does not let fuel ,  medicine ,  doctors ,  lawyers ,  reporter or any official go to the camp or the sick get to the hospital .  5 cancer patients died ,  without even a pain killer given to them .  they buy everything by their own money and still maliki does not let it enter the camp .  maliki now has the dead line to close the camp by end of this year ,  meaning to kill them all .  this is because of ignorant west ,  including switzerland ,  us ,  british ,  and many other countries decided to go and bring democracy for iraq !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  .  that’s the democracy; a full blooded iranian raised dictator came to power .  why west is helping this government that has killed many of its own people and is attacking political refugees .  mojahedion are in this mess ,  because of the war that these countries created and were involved directly or indirectly ,  so it is the law and they have to help them .  by the way ,  don’t worry where we go in us ,  i see in thailand you must be very busy on the streets .  not everybody like you has ties with dictators and mullahs to get blood money ,  we work
__label__0 @mina ,  united states ,  before you ever hit a keyboard again accusing the swiss and switzerland in general of collaborating and participating in the attacks on ,  and ongoing war activity in iraq and afghanistan in addition to hoarding billions of dollars in their coffers ,  get the reality and facts straight  (  .  .  .  )  by now switzerland has participated more than enough to accommodate hundreds of thousands of innocent  ( and many of not so harmless or legitimate )  war refugees and asylum seekers since the beginning of wwii .  do you expect the swiss to harbor just about any and all political or religious dissidents ,  rebels and revolutionaries from around the world if they are considered agitators or demagogues ,  either by their own government or any host country ?  why don ' t you address your grievances with the parties ,  organizations  ( including the un )  and countries at fault or move to your countries of concern and participate and help in their struggle and movement for  ' freedom '  in their specific doctrine ,  interests and demands and leave the swiss in their now progressively endangered peace .

__label__0 lynx: "scared of taking risks" is not the right motivation .  it is more a deeply entrenched suspicion on any state-run entity that implies an enormous apparatchik .  most of these independent "mutuals" have a fairly light infrastructure .  by combining them all into one mastodon ,  the number of "indians" required for the processing of invoices would hardly decrease .  however ,  there would be several layers of highly paid "chiefs" as in any big organization .  moreover ,  the absence of competition does not normally work in favor of the consumer .

__label__0 it ' s a classic vicious circle .  first ,  you create a system that allows a bankrupt state to hurt "good" ones .  then you create a mechanism to control bankrupt states – which actually means "all states" .  then you create an authority to enforce this mechanism .  then you create a commission to control this authority .  then you create another authority to coordinate this commission .  .  .  and so on ,  and so forth .  it ' s just endless .  at some stage you get a huge and clumsy bureaucratic structure that can ' t solve any problem and simply reproduces itself .  this is one of the main reasons why totalitarian systems are doomed to fall .  is that the game we want to play ,  honestly ?

__label__0 democracy certainly can’t be dumped on a population that has no experience of using the institution without results that that population may well not find averse ,  to say the least .  the problem that needs most immediate attention in switzerland is a democracy of long years that now wishes to surrender its democratic nature in return for a simplistic story of nationalistic / racial superiority .  @ orca: who signed up for these deals with schiess üüslander ?  some foreign invader ?  no ,  the helvetian stammvolk .  how do you like this outcome of democracy ? 
__label__0 any than why isn ' t the killing of thousands if not hundreds of thousands innocent victims ,  execution like deaths ,  caused by the war mongers over the past decades not being headlined or worthwhile to be written about ?  where are the ,  i believe more justifiable denouncements and condemnation by the anti-death penalty crowd ? 
__label__0 well ,  you give so called facts ,  but where are your sources to back them up ?  thoughts that come out of your head are not facts but simply personal opinion .  just a quick tour of the site deathpenaltyinfo . org reveals some pretty interesting facts about capital punishment ,  such as: - the death penalty is 2-3 times more costly than life imprisonment - the death penalty does not act as a deterrent to murder - there is huge discrimination with regards to race .  in cases of interracial murders ,  there have been 15 executions of a white defendant and black victim vs .  246 when the victim was white and the defendant was black .  several studies have revealed the fact that blacks killing white people are way more likely to be executed than the other way round .  a just system should not discriminate ,  right ?  -  .  .  .   ( many more facts )  but what we often forget is that many criminals incarcerated today suffer from some kind of mental illness ,  thus they do not always make a conscious choice about their crimes .  we also forget that no justice system is infallible ,  which means that innocent people are being killed in the process .  can a society that calls itself civilized ignore and even justify the killings of innocent people ?  we also choose to ignore the suffering the family of the person convicted has to go through ,  and i am glad someone is trying to show this side of the death penalty .  just read on .  many reports for viable sources are available ,  which often shows considerable drawbacks to this system and very little benefits ,  if any at all . 
__label__0 i do not understand your statement ,  as the right to vote in majority of countries is linked to citizenship and not residence .  most likely these swiss expats you talk about cannot vote in those countries that they live in .  in certain countries at the municipal level foreign nationals can vote ,  but at the national level this is not the case .  after you have lived the required amount of years and apply and become a swiss citizen ,  you will be able to vote . 
__label__0 i 1000% agree with you !  some expats are extremely arrogant and want to complain ,  yet they come to switzerland to live in the beauty it has to offer .  if they had their way with switzerland it would turn into a hellhole ! 
__label__0 ahem ,  everything in switzerland is absolutely perfect .  and you  ( we )  must not ever even attempt to rock that boat !  otherwise the swiss will get very upset and feel even more threatened by  ( us )  outsiders . 
__label__0 hey ,  true swiss !  do you want to kill your culture ,  ecology and economy ?  if not ,  why on the earth you let the  (  .  .  .  )  become residents of the switzerland so easy ?  people ,  who give no  (  .  .  .  )  about your culture and traditions ?  people ,  who just want sitting on the social aid forever ?  i am living in neuchatel and i see these people every day .  you want here another detroit ?  - you are on the right track then .  .  .  if i ' d become a citizen of this country ,  the very first thing i would do - join the svp party . 
__label__0 ariely: i have been scratching my head over this problem for quite a while .  why is it that christians have so little understanding for the jewish community who are our remote cousins ?  a friend told me that possibly they still cannot forgive their forefathers to have killed our prophet - over two thousand years ago !  i admire the spanish king who officially apologized to the community for the cruelties committed by the queen "isabel la catolica" .

__label__0 the slippery slope argument is ridiculous and getting old .  polygamy has been around for thousands of years and is being practiced in the very countries where being homosexual is a crime .  bestiality is a rare phenomenon and is also mentioned in the bible .  it is ridiculous to supposed tat accepting gay marriage or homosexuality would lead to things that already pre-exist .  there is nothing causal going on here except in the minds of people who are offended by hoosexuality . 
__label__0 my long reply detailing the entire literature on this was not published by swiss info .  but to keep it short: 1 ) you pretend rights operate asymmetrically when in fact they do not; 2 ) you have not cited any peer reviewed academics ,  merely given us assertions; 3 ) you deploy ad hominem attacks about how the experts - widely cited and respected - are fanatical  ( according to whom ?  which criteria ?  your personal beliefs or by the data ?  )  4 )  i have yet to see the cladestine nature your refer to - perhaps you might like to explain san fran 5 )  the issue has never been what they do in the privacy of their bedroom ,  but the state rewarding and bringing attention to it . 
__label__0 if socialism is such a wonderful system ,  why does one socialist economy after another collapse under the weight of inefficiency and ineptitude and convert to capitalism: china ,  ussr and all of it ' s satellites ,  north korea ,  cuba ?  corruption and greed are a part of human nature .  under socialism ,  capitalism doesn ' t disappear ,  it merely goes underground and a huge capitalistic black market is formed .  the result is an official economy that stagnates and an unofficial economy that escapes control ,  taxation and regulation thus rendering the state unable to perform its duties .  capitalism on the other hand promotes merit and innovation resulting in greater efficiency ,  a better use of resources and a higher standard of living .  corruption exists equally in both systems .  those countries that do the best job limiting corruption and who bring opportunity and meritocracy to the masses have the highest standard of living .  unfortunately ,  mankind’s attempts to manage the cyclical nature of the economy remain unsuccessful .  when growth spirals out of control due to misguided strategies or policies ,  we are left with an opposite and equally out of control contraction .  unfortunately ,  short sightedness is also universal .  .  .

__label__0 orca: you are right ,  sometimes a government change means more of the same or even worse .  next to voicing my displeasure about the gaddafi regime many times ,  i systematically boycotted the tamoil gas stations and encouraged my acquaintances to do likewise .  our government could have done more ,  especially after the max göldi scandalous kidnapping .  let us hope a transition for the better works this time . 
__label__0 immigrants do not build houses or apartments .  again we see an ill-thought about foreigners .  this is so unfair .  the uncoordinated urbanization is more due to the swiss culture of doing things their own way ,  without following a strict common rule .  where there are no visible rule ,  a swiss neighbour can build almost anything after they agree with their friendly gemeinderat or kanton .  it is surely a swiss thing to keep things different ,  just look at how many different sets of kantonal interpretations of the laws .  it is not wrong ,  it is just a fact .

__label__1 what ? 
__label__0 maybe private schools are expensive for you but obviously not to others who feel they gain something for their children ' s futures .  i won ' t get into it here but the difference in outcomes is huge .  the probability of ease of entry into good and great universities is much higher .  don ' t be so simple minded .  these choices are not about buying lunchtime babysitting .  i think the only point worth discussing here is that those who wish to choose private schools have every right to do so without the tyranny and lecturing of the masses . 
__label__0 now it is maybe you who is assuming too much ?  i had my kids in private school  ( i was privately educated too in the uk )  ,  and can easily afford to so again without any noticeable financial discomfort - but i chose not too because i have seen through their veil of lip-service .  but it wasn ' t always that way ,  and i know many people who pour all their available their money into it .  you are propagating the marketing nonsense of such schools when you make outrageous claims about ease of entry into unis .

__label__0 regine aeppli is from the socialist party  ( which is not centre-left but just left )  therefore we can conclude this has nothing to do with feelings of local identity because a )  she would not care and b )  it simplly doesn ' t make sense .  i suspect at the core of this is the leftist fight against the wealthy and priviledged .  for a local swiss a private school is a much more expensive solution then sending their children to normal public school ,  and we are talking about the locals here .  so why would you do it ?  because nowadays the swiss become a minority in their own public schools ,  forced to go at the speed together with immigrant kids from rather poor and uneducated background .  secondly the chance for violence and drugs are smaller at private schools ,  supervision is higher and private schools are not involved in all kind of leftist social experiments with the school plan .  if i had to choose i would send my daughter as well to private school .  nothing right-wing here just parents trying to avoid the results of bad politics . 
__label__0 "go at the speed of immigrant kids from rather poor .  . " - so as a society we should give up on them ,  and others who can ' t afford private schools ?  there ' s more responsibility needed here than just ensuring your own kids have it good . 
__label__1 so ,  the solution is to create ghettos based on the ideas of the middle and lower classes ?  ?  ?  ?  as i graduated top notch private ,  global universities ,  i hardly believe my daughter ,  after being dumbed down by her swiss teachers and family and the all-knowing locals ,  will ever look down on me ,  except out of ignorance ,  envy and insecurity .  the truth is that the all-knowing ,  undereducated are the reason that most rich folks don ' t bother to try to "integrate" with the middle .  the middle obsesses about not being pulled down by poor immigrants while the rich have to worry about not being pulled down by the middle . 
__label__0 agree .  now the affluent ,  educated ,  mobile swiss who are a minority can see firsthand how their not-so-endowed compatriots will use politics to express their envy and fear by bullying minorities .  i think the well-educated ,  both swiss and foreign ,  should go on strike  ( or leave the country altogether )  and let the not-so-endowed see how well the economy would run after such a brain drain .

__label__0 james: it has been an ongoing argument whether germany would have done better by opting out of the euro .  maybe ,  if she had not converted east marks at par instead of the more realistic 25 pfennigs .  since year-end 1998 ,  the euro lost 24 . 3% ,  the swedish crown 21 . 2% and sterling 38 . 8% against the franc .   .  if the euro were to be dismantled completely  ( because germany and other stronger eu countries “pulled the plug” )  the historic conversion rate of 1 . 95583 could indeed serve as a base for reverting back to square one .  at the 1 . 35 you mention the parity for the “new” mark would be at 0 . 69 francs .  that would still be more than ten per cent below the 0 . 80 previously considered as normal by our central bank .   .  it is unclear under which conditions the euro could disintegrate and to what extent eu politicians are aware of the enormous cost this “exercise” would incur .  as a reminder ,  before the euro introduction ,  the local currency capital markets outside the mark  ( being itself quite small by international comparison )  were small or even tiny and the borrowing costs significantly higher .  even france had to borrow several times in us dollars that caused significant problems when the greenback rose .  moreover ,  the cost of converting individual european currencies forth and back was substantial .  reputed economists estimated that it could easily represent 0 . 5 per cent of gdp growth .  all things considered ,  it may be quite a bit cheaper for the eu to take any measures to ensure that the “bad pupils” get their act together .

__label__0 i agree ,  there are many reasons for the franc to be overvalued ,  both political and economical .  however ,  i ' m not sure if the market is willing to "think" rationally .  all in all ,  it depends on the sobriety of the eu leaders .  i hope they ' ll accept the reality before it ' s too late .  if people don ' t bury their dead ,  they ' ll be poisoned .  euro-poisoning must be stopped ,  the sooner the better .

" .  .  . and if the lives saved by "usa vigilantism" was that high ,  it would be reported" .  first ,  this isn´t vigilantism ,  secondly ,  people do have a natural right to defend themselves and their property with guns and guess what ?  it does not get reported when that happens .  it only does when there is a misuse of firearms ,  but it never gets reported when it is used in the defense of property or one´s own life .  why ?  ask the us doj that .  you want to verify the statistics i laid here ?  go to the doj site .  the last thing the marxist anti-gun media wants is to report honestly the success rate of people who defend themselves with a firearm .  don´t take my word for it .  just do a little research with the competent forums and find out for yourself .

__label__0 these numbers seem right to me .  i compare myself with my colleagues and of the 10 males i would consider 7 overweight with 3 seriously health damaging fat .  of the 4 women ,  3 overweight ,  and of them 2 seriously health damaging fat .  the painful side of all this is that they consider me underweight / skinny when the fact is i am a handful of pounds over an ideal healthy weight .  my  ' secret '  is eat what you want but not after 8pm .  also no alcohol and avoid meat .  exercise 2 times a week ,  45 minutes ,  and cycle to work  ( ~60ks per week )  . 
__label__0 the swiss must ask the question ,  "were relations with the united states better ten years ago than they are now ? " .  if the answer is yes ,  the swiss must then ask ,  where did we go wrong ,  and what can we do to get back on track ?

__label__0 @emmanuel bamidele actually i believe , if saif al-islam is tried in den hague ( where the icc is located )  he has better chances to walk out free , as he has legal reasons to claim , he acted in self-defence . he had to defend himself , because there was a very aproximate danger on his life , resulting from the armed fighting of the rebbels .  acc . to the geneva convention the icc ought to prove , that he ( not his father or somebody else !  )  commited genocide .

__label__0 when an individual passes on their wealth to a family member and is not taxed ,  how is this "the rich getting richer at the expense of others ? " how are "others" paying anything out of their pockets ?  it ' s just liberals are being denied a chance to take from thsoe that earned it and redistribute it to those that do not do anything to earn it . 
__label__1 i mentioned the same thing: it is inmoral .  by promoting this collectivists kill the compasion we all feel naturally and that is what hurst society .  .  . not to mention how they empower government so that it can abuse people ,  increase ineficiencies and corruption ,  and generate moral hazard . 
__label__0 there is substantial monetary inflation coming as a result of the fiat franc and ecb and snb policies .  as a result ,  although chf 2m appears a lot today ,  in the future ,  it will be a modest middle class estate value .  without inflation adjustment ,  this will be mainly a middle class tax ,  as the wealthy will avoid it by the mechanisms listed in the article as well as other mechanisms . 
__label__0 here are two quotations from us history that explain the old game of fiat currency manipulation that central banks engage in:  ( 1 )  "if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency ,  first by inflation and then by deflation ,  the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children will wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered . " – thomas jefferson  ( 2 )  there are two ways to conquer and enslave a nation .   one is by the sword .  the other is by debt .  - john adams preventing this is why gold based currencies were in the old swiss constitution and the current us constitution . 
__label__0 and how about a "stop police violence against peaceful protestors" campaign ? 
__label__1 excellent five years in the can ,  i have nothing against xamax ,  wish you all the best .  but this guy was a joke .  when i first saw this letter on the news it looked like a letter from the count of monte cristo not from the bank of america .  it looks like chagaev needs to send his hoods to school .  . this has wannabe mafia written all over it ! 
__label__1 not that your comment has anything to do with these beautiful ,  illustrated works of the bible ,  but your comment disregards the simple fact that the arabs control 98% of the middle east land .  condoning the slaughter of folks like the fogel family last year ,  while they slept in their beds ,  because israel now exists on 1% of middle east land ,  could only be considered logical by a fanatic ,  like you .

__label__0 once again the swiss overstate their importance to the world .  if the us loses a few people who are american and swiss because of banking issues ,  do you really think it will bring the us financial market to its knees ?  come on .  .  . get real .  if you don ' t want to pay taxes in the usa ,  then turn in your passport and pay your taxes in switzerland .  after living in the us for many years and living in switzerland for 8 years i can tell you that paying taxes in switzerland is at least three times higher than paying taxes living in the usa .  again .  . another case of the swiss overstating their importance  ( in this case financial )  to the world !  ! 
__label__0 you just aren ' t thinking this through .  it ' s not just the swiss -- it ' s the whole eu that is rebelling against these reporting regulations because they ' re costly and violate privacy regulations .  so what those banks are doing is starting to refuse accounts to u . s .  citizens or anyone who has a u . s .  green card .  if they refuse u . s .  customers ,  they can stay within u . s regulations without making those expensive changes .   ( many swiss cantonal banks are already doing this .  )  what this means is that u . s .  citizens living abroad are going to have a harder and harder time operating on the local economy .  you can ' t make it here without a bank account -- your employer deposits your paycheck there ,  and how are you going to pay your bills ?  in cash ?  you ' d better believe that european / swiss banks are going to want to retain access to vast u . s .  resources ,  and the way they ' ll manage that is by rejecting the business of individual u . s .  citizens abroad .  the ranting about turning in your passport doesn ' t make sense either -- you *can ' t* turn in your passport and quit paying taxes in the u . s .  first ,  you have to have citizenship someplace else .  second ,  you need to go through a process that takes years .  third ,  if you own more than 2 million in assets  ( which is basically a house ,  if you live in switzerland )  you still have pay taxes for a decade *after* renouncing your citizenship .  plus ,  if you live in switzerland ,  you *have* to pay swiss taxes ,  so you can ' t  ( as you suggest )  just pay your u . s .  taxes .  the bottom line is that the u . s .  wants its citizens living abroad to pay double taxes on any income above the maximum income credit for expats  ( $80 , 000 ,  i believe )  .  other nations don ' t do this because being doubly taxed is simply unfair .

__label__0 books in switzerland are hideously overpriced ,  fixed prices will only drive people to digital downloads more quickly .  have people learned nothing from the record industry ?  i have lived in switzerland for 8 years and in that time i have never bought a book here ,  why should i when i can buy at a third the price in another eu country ?  the economic situation will put more pressure on prices and if you want book sales to increase ,  cut prices . 
__label__0 the gripen e / f is not only much lower total cost ,  and multi role ,  it is also capable of super cruise intercepts with air to air missiles .  the us air force doesn ' t have that capability except with the heavy and incredibly expensive f-22 .  the typhoon can do it but at twice the cost .  i am sick and tired of ignorant people who think that the gripen is a useless toy .  it is a plane with a plan for cleverness and sustainability in war and economy in peace .  it is the other planes that are expensive jokes created by prestige bound empty heads ,  not the gripen . 
__label__0 i used to work at ubs for many years .  i saw many cases where senior managers proceeded to "hide" recognized risks in view of it affecting their bonuses  ( got to hit the project target dates )  .  we brought to their attention some risks with bcm ,  and they promptly fired those people who took the initative to point it out to ed level people .  also ,  they keep regurgetating terms like itil and "best practices" - but often times md and ed people just ignored them in order to push ahead  ( eg - no proper testing of planned ict changes like new code or infra changes )  of course this is a simiar practice by other companies .  just that the senior manager bonus system is a root cause for the ignorance for risk .  lastly ,  how this one trader with a "d" level ,  have access to trades of 2 billion .  normally they do not have signing power so high .  yes ,  the fat lady is still sitting on the side line .  .  .  . 
__label__0 switzerland is corrupt ,  like every other country .  they are just better at hiding it . 
__label__1 get rid of this scum  ,  all of it  ,  the sooner the better . 
__label__0 from the very beginning the us was opposed to the eu and the euro ,  seeing it as an impediment to us hegemony .  i just hope that the us '   ' wish '  doesn ' t become reality .  the largest debtor nation walking away the winner !  ? 
__label__0 while as an american ,  i share discomfort at the foreign policy of my country on many occasions ,  i try to examine both its successes and failures .  i contrast it with german foreign policy: "do nothing ,  for as long as i can ,  and lets pretend the outside world does not exist" .  germany needs to prepare itself for the new world ,  where increasingly itself and france will be forced to address regional and international issues  ( nuclear proliferation as an example )  ,  with much reduced involvement from the us .  this will be an uncomfortable new era for germany ,  and is going to make the experience it had in afghanistan as an example seem pleasant in comparison .  good luck . 
__label__0 yes ,  promotion of ideas such as loving your neighbor as yourself ,  being a servant to others ,  telling the truth ,  abstaining from murder and violence ,  honoring your parents ,  being faithful to your spouse ,  caring for the poor and oppressed in society ,  standing by your word ,  believing that one day you will have to give an account of your actions to god - all of this is extremely dangerous and subversive stuff in our day and age . 
__label__0 chemistry is great yo . 
__label__0 what a miserable ,  biased article .  question: what is a "tax haven" ?  answer: a place where the order of a judge is needed to put your nose in someone else bank account ,  and where taxes are slightly lower than the confiscatory systems in place in other places .  and another ,  rhetorical question .  why it is assumed that any money that is deposited in switzerland must be the result of crimes and tax evasion ?  i guess all the jews who deposited in switzerland their money during and before ww2 were all criminals ,  acording to the nazi ?  and finally ,  it is bs that public opinion is against bank secrecy . 
__label__0 i believe the objective in recent attacks on swiss banking secrecy are twofold ,  first to reverse recent eu flight of capital to move money back to banks money has been fleeing from in greece ,  italy ,  spain ,  portugal and france ,  and second ,  to enable future asset taxes .  getting money back into questionably solvent banks allows it ' s seizure via capital controls and inflation ,  while asset taxes allow for direct seizure .  historically ,  there is nothing new or innovative here .  this situation has caused some persons to react by removing assets from the global banking system . 
__label__0 "the swiss sports ministry and parliament are also looking into the past activities of the zurich-based organisation . " finally ,  long overdue .  swiss reputation has been badly damaged by fifa and several other organisations based in switzerland who are apparently not answerable to anyone but their members .  the swiss authorities turn a blind eye to the practices of many of these organisations because they want them to stay rather than uproot and go to asia where ethical standards are sometimes non-existent .  in fact i can see in the next 10 years that many organisations will leave ch on the pretext of being too expensive with the real reason being that as secret banking and other practices are opened up to srutiny their officals need somewhere dodgy to keep hidden their dirty dealings . 
__label__0 the unions want a minimum wage because they want more power for themselves .  by taking away the negotiating power that currently exists directly between the employee and employer ,  they hope to insert themselves into more such relationships to their own profit .

__label__0 researchers need to " research " something  ,  right  ?  so some find evidence of climate change  ,  other find evidence to the contrary  .  its a living for profs and phd candidates  ,  thats all  . 
__label__0 yes ,  what you are saying is very true and the swiss parliment and government are like third world puppets ready and willing to serve to every whim of the us government .  they should act like a sovereign country instead of a spineless lap dog ready and willing to serve every whim of the us government .  total and complete hypocrites . 
__label__0 indeed ,  impossibility is nothing ! keep it up ,  boys . 
__label__0 brilliant .  i was getting really fed-up with english and dutch pre-game coverage ,  which portrayed it as an easy roll-over for manchester . 
__label__0 this is another attempt at instigating a revolution in a country in which certain western powers want to grab the resources .  it is absolutely clear what is happening here .  if the duplicituous western nations whose police pepper spray peaceful demonstrators are really complaining about vote rigging then it would be the second party who would benefit the most .  the second party is the communist party !  how ludicruous that neo-liberal zionist western plutocrats would support the communists coming into power !  ha ha !  no ,  the real agenda is to de-stabilise russia and create a civil war and then go for the resource grab .  much as i may dislike the russian elite at least they fundamentally have russian interests at heart ,  not some other country ' s .  yes they need to clan up the corruption but they are not traitors . 
__label__0 debt based monetary systems ,  such as the euro ,  usd ,  and chf ,  historically have failed when the debt becomes so large that it cannot be serviced .  economic growth ,  either real or nominal  ( inflation )  ,  is required to keep the debt serviceable .  inflation caused voltaire to say in 1729 "paper money eventually returns to its intrinsic value - zero . "
__label__1 since when israel makes demands to switzerland ?  could they ever make demands to any country at a particular forum ?  i do not think so .  frau .  gotlieb is not the only one who can ' t tolerate that jews have the nerve to have their country with their own laws .

__label__0 humbug !  the snb has been creating money out of thin air and lending it to banks at zero to  . 125 % interest since 2008 .  the banks lend this money to you and me for 2% interest for a variable mortgage for example .  that cheap new money is finding it ' s way into the swiss housing industry and is called inflation .  we are now being warned of a pending real estate bubble in switzerland  ( see swissinfo headline "boom pushes property market to the limit" for example )  .  this is just one way how the increased liquidity is finding its way into our every day lives .  we are living in dire times .  the monetary base has not been so much manipulated since the 1930 ' s  ( look at the statistical raw data available at the snb archives online )  . 
__label__0 the un ipcc has proven to be not a scientific organization but a political organization to promote such as the kyoto accord and the green climate fund to forcefully take from successful ,  prosperous governments and give to failed ,  oppressive governments .

__label__0 where i live ,  there is one train ticket machine .  the bus i need to take first arrives maximum 2 minutes before the train .  if more than 2 people want to buy a ticket ,  now i will have to let the train leave rather than get on and get a fine .  i cannot buy a ticket on the bus for trips outside the kanton where i live .  what does sbb propose for those of us who live in farmerland ?  get a car ,  perhaps . 
__label__0 in the age of smart phones ,  i totally agree with sbb on making people who try to dodge paying for a ticket pay the fine .  in the rest of the world this is standard practice but as soon as the swiss decide to do it ,  everyone screams blue murder .  considering the sbb was on of the first companies to come up with an application on smart phones and to offer the possiblity to buy tickets on your phone ,  people have no excuse to not have a ticket anymore . 
__label__0 as a female i am very troubled by the idea of trains without any conductors .  but i also smell some hypocrisy or doublespeak when they say that making tickets unavailable on board frees up conductors to help passengers ?  what conductors ? 
__label__0 i agree with you ,  actually i ' m a bit surprised at switzerland .  in truth ,  there isn ' t much the us can do if there ' s no bank branch on their soil .  its nothing but bullying .  .  .

__label__0 expat in swtzerland pays health insurances ,  taxes ,  unemployment insurance but has to leave country if one looses job ( can ' t work even if  ' finds a job '  as some permits does not allow .  good news-at least can take his social benefit contributions expat in us all the above . "50%" taxes .  has to leave country if looses job .  social contributions are  ' donation '  to the us govt .  what is china doing different from  ' morally correct '  western governments ?  who the hell is complaining to pay local taxes ? 
__label__0 one can imagine the same scenarios in a few more eu countries .  what can be expected after a couple of decades of buying asian junk ,  closing down ones own factories borrowing to buy junk so china can get rich overnight ,  funding nato and its stupid wars which only serve to make supposed "instant capitalism &amp; democracy" popular ,  and the circus goes on and on . 
__label__0 i totally agree with you .  the person who has responded to your comment shows this .  how to respect foreigners ?  do not say to them  ' get out of the country if you can ' t speak swiss german '  ,  do not accuse the coloured family in the apartment building of placing the garbage a day early when it is the swiss family ,  do not lie and say an apartment is taken because the landlord does not want a coloured tenent ,  the list goes on and on and on .  .  .  .  .  a typical swiss gustapo asking what are your  ' qualifications '  - switzerland does not produce any qualified people because of the dismal education system that is why most of the skilled force are from outside .  yet they boast and belittle the education system outside because this is the only way to prove theirs is better .  harvard university ,  mit university accepts students from world class universities such as ucl ,  imperial  ( swiss probably have not even heard of them )  however university of basel would not - a place where a bachelors degree takes over 5 years !  ! 
__label__0 i am an australian working with asylum seekers in lausanne for the last two years .  i see the difficulties  ' foreigners '  have seeking employment and accommodation every day .  many highly qualified but of course not able to speak the right language .  it is easy to come to switzerland and work for the multi nationals who are just here for tax purposes but i see many difficulties her for non-white europeans who want to be an active and integral part of swiss society .  i was abused by a swiss man for driving down a road that was closed to traffic .  not explained to turn around and go another way .  abused .  he was the only other car on the road .  i ' m moving back to australia in a month ' s time .  i will welcome all cultures with open arms especially the swiss . 
__label__0 ah ,  but the  ' climate is climate '  brigade likes to point out that many of the warmest years globally on record are in the last 20 years and that there has been no  ' global '   ( as in opposite to  ' local '  )  cold spell in many years  ( in fact since 1945-46 if my memory is correct )  .  i am just trying to point out that we should stop using facts as opinions and opinions as facts ,  just because it suits our own interests . 
__label__0 excellent points ,  but people have every right to be wary of major expansion plans because there will be no going back once these things are in place .  the beauty of some of these resorts is they are unique ,  even a bit quirky ,  and what the ski business executives see as problems the locals and devoted fans see as part of their charm .  generally ,  i ' m a fan of vail resorts but people have a love / hate relationship with them for a reason .  an example would be their proposed expansion plans at breckenridge that even the normally expansion-friendly locals are balking at . 
__label__0 modernizing is good and fine ,  but at what cost ?  i am a swiss citizen living in canada and worked in whistler on three occasions for an international hotel chain .  i consider whistler to be an overpriced failure .  this is a resort for the hoi ti toity ,  not for the average person .  locals cannot afford to live there ,  as it is extremely expensive and they have to find accommodation in neighbouring towns .  as a local you have to work three jobs to survive in whistler .  whistler has lost some of the local business .  in difficult times a resort depends on the local business .  local is vancouver and seattle ,  anywhere from 2 - 4 hours away from the resort .  whistler also charges for parking .  so a day of skiing in whistler for a family of four amounts to approx .  $1000 . - dollars .  this total does not include accommodation .  i know my figures are correct because i keep track of my family ' s expenses .  our family of four can no longer afford whistler ,  and we are not extravagent consumers .  the swiss resorts have to improve their customer service .  you are losing also your local customers to surrounding countries .  i hear that from my own family who live in switzerland .  listen to your local people on what can be improved and also do exit surveys  ( after a customer leaves )  .  paying some high priced overseas consultant expert who possibly has no idea of the local sentiments is a crying shame .  build on what you have and respect your traditions and diversity .  do not become a cookie cutter resort .  as a tourist i look forward to different experiences .  why would any resort in their right mind want to copy whistler ?  ?  whistler has its own problems .  their on-slope dining experience is horrific .  fast food junk and burgers at high prices is not the answer .  our last business in whistler was operating a 24 person bed and breakfast .  we had tourist from europe .  almost all of them said that whistler ' s slope-side experience was terrible and overpriced .  not to mention a lack of atmosphere .  they all said that they have experienced whistler ,  but won ' t come back .  there was no bang for their buck .

__label__0 it is not at all surprising that so many eu citizens wish to make their home in switzerland .  yes ,  there are economic considerations but the main reasons are not about money but about freedom and the quality of life in the eu .  the eu is undemocratic ,  badly run and led by a group of self serving greedy politicans who want to control everything their citizens are allowed to do .  they forget they are supposed to serve the citizen .  i for one have had enough of big brother and am so glad that i have effectively been granted political asylum and escaped from britain and the rest of the corrupt and dis-credited eu .  long may switzerland remain exactly as it is and thanks for allowing my family to live in your wonderful and free country . 
__label__0 we don`t need more people turning up in switzerland ,  we have enough people here ,  too many criminals have turned up ,  and besides we are only a small country ,  we can`t fit everyone in .  it`s also a sign of arrogance when people think they can just turn up without being invited .  fix up the problems in your own countries then you don`t have to run away ,  running away never solves anything .  i don`t like the idea of my taxes being used to support people that just want to come here and use the social welfare system for their own benefit ,  we don`t need bludgers here ! 
__label__0 any concern about the many swiss citizens that were forced  ' onto the street '  over the past decades because of loss of jobs ?  unemployment caused by outsourcing of work to  ' cheaper '  eu countries or south / south-east asia or the now prevalent lower wage labor force movement from eastern european countries into switzerland ,  effects and a result of the "personenfreizügigkeit" agreements with the eu .  thank you . 
__label__0 20 ' 000 asylum requests through the month of november ?  perhaps we should prepare now for a flood of requests over the next few years .

__label__0 @steffi ,  united states: so you base your opinion based upon a story written by one ,  one of the hundreds of us air force crew members that were "interned"  ( they were not considered or treated as pow ' s as stated in many publications )  in switzerland after either seeking "safe" emergency landings ,  crash landings or bailing out over non-enemy territory .  i suggest that you search for publications about the hundreds of us air force crew members that spent some reasonable good times in internment camps  ( some of them converted hotels )  in resort towns .  i do not question dan culler ' s experience in switzerland ,  i ,  and you should question why he was ever sent to the wauwilermoos prison .  what has he done to deserve that ?  i ' ll bet that most us internees enjoyed better living conditions in their camps than the majority of the swiss defense forces during that period .  in conclusion and you ought to know ,  during world war ii ,  30 swiss soldiers were sentenced to death and 17 of these were executed before the end of the war for treason .  instead of digging up and questioning events and activities by the swiss government during wwii decades ago ,  i suggest that you look into the  ( 200 , 000++ )  civilian war casualties caused by one specific nation in action since the 1990 ' s in iraq ,  afghanistan and who knows wherelse . 
__label__0 fred you are 110% correct .  well said ! 
__label__0 i would like to commend @ra for a well written commentary on the state of the us .  you did loose me on the income redistribution part though as that is a too socialist position for me .  eliminating special interest lobbyist ,  tort reform and a simplified tax code revolving around a flat tax would go a long ways towards creating equality and hopefully less hostile polarization of the electorate .  @fred - i agree with you that much can be learned from switzerland but don ' t forget how many people like wally herger  ( who happens to be my congressman ) and who like myself and many others ,  are descendents of swiss immigrants who have made the us for better or worse of what she is today .  many good things have been done by the people of america and switzerland so hopefully we can continue to work towards "a more perfect union" with each others help .  nobody every said that democracy wasn ' t messy and perfect .  my answer to the question of @fred being a traitor for have renounced his citizenship .  i think someone truly misjudges the us as a country with that question .  does that mean as i would be viewed as a traitor for have dual us and swiss citizenship ?  as a veteran who has served in the us military i would find that a disturbing prospect .  does switzerland think you are a traitor because you immigrated to another country ?  i think not and the same could be said for the us too .  like @ra try and give the us some credit for doing some things right and we are a work in progress .

__label__0 the problem with direct democracy is allowing a majority to vote away the rights of a minority; two wolves and a sheep voting on what to have for dinner .  in this case voting away the private wealth of private citizens .  socialists can ' t stand the idea of people deciding for themselves what they want to do with their own money so they work to steal it at every opportunity . 
__label__0 the rules of taxation are very simple .  if the taxman tries to rip off the tax payer than they are only ripping thrmselves off .  if the tax payer is ripping off the taxman than they are ripping themselves off .  taxation must be in harmony where proficiency in growth is the ultimate objective therefore both sides  ( government and private )  must be in perfect harmony and in full trust with only one goal and that is to inforce national security and capital growth for the whole nation in this case switzerland .  to those who do not abide by this natural rule are nothing more than treasonist of their people .  that is why comprehensiveness is vital ,  specially for such a small simons such as switzerland !

__label__0 max ,  i suppose i could clarify .  i am abolishing business taxes ,  income taxes ,  payroll taxes and property taxes and replacing them with a flat tax on land .  economic theory suggests that this would reduce unemployment 1 )  new companies will set up and be attracted to the tax incentive – indeed ,  companies might leave liechtenstein  ( switzerland’s main competitor for tax rates )  and take advantage of these “better” tax rates – in particular ,  i’d like to see manufacturing  ( goods ,  chemicals )  and scientific  ( biotechnology )  employment rise in switzerland ,  which in turn requires demand for local labour; 2 )  there is no red tape or paperwork or “deadweight loss” so there is no disincentive to work  ( as now you are not being taxed for the fruits of your labor )  or for employers not to hire more people as a result; 3 )  vacant land would be put into use ,  as a result new land will be opened to new businesses .  ironically ,  we are told by max: “the corporate tax rate is very low and the cost of housing has become unaffordable for the common citizen” .  but is that not the precise argument for land tax ?  indeed ,  land tax is criticised because it reduces land values  ( by making the land an unprofitable investment )  .  land tax means: * all land must be put to its productive use  ( yes – even land which is currently idle and withdrawn from the market in order create artificially “low” supply for land speculators ) ; * to meet the tax ,  it means you must find tenants to house to give you an additional cashflow .  this means you must build or improve your land to discharge the cashflow from the tax  ( you might even have a paye rate )  .  competition between landlords means those who offer reasonable rates will get the cashflow .  more rent / accommodation means lower rent *in the long run* .  * other areas might want to compete with zug .  finally ,  i am not sure how its practicability leaves anyone in doubt  ( various forms operate in singapore ,  hong kong ,  parts of the us ,  australia )  .  do landlords keep 30% of the windfall ?  or 50% ?  why should they keep any part of the windfall owing from population growth or zoning ?  indeed ,  the fact they are already paying for windfalls suggests the system is perfectly practical .  i hope this is a misunderstanding as i doubt you are saying “32874320847382 taxes on everyone”  ( the status quo )  is better than a simple ,  efficient flat land tax which replaces these uncompetitive taxes ( so “rents” ,  not capital or labor ,  fund government expenditure )  . 
__label__0 james is right .  i would love to have the choice of saving in a gold franc rather than keeping hildebrand ' s fiat franc .  twice since 2008 the men is gray suits of the governing board have each time more than doubled the monetary base  ( some call that money out of thin air )  .  something is very rotten in switzerland ,  buy some vrenelis while you still can . 
__label__0 the constitution of 1874 required sound money ,  whereas the constitution of 2000 does not .  given the radical debasement of the fiat franc by mr hildebrand ' s snb ,  switzerland would clearly benefit from either a gold franc competing with hildebrand ' s fiat franc ,  or a return to sound money . 
__label__0 questions: * what peer-reviewed paper are you citing to prove "we have over 3800 examples of fiat currencies becoming worthless course of monetary history" ?  * were they "fiat" ,  in the sense of flexible exchange rates  ( rather than pegged exchange rates )  and the ability of a national government to set interest rates based on local conditions ?  [for the record the only **ever** default in a fiat currency ,  as defined ,  occurred in 1945 - when the japanese government refused to pay its american bondholders after they just nuked it ! ] * were the inflation the result of supply-side shocks ?  would free banking make africa prosper ?  * how do you explain the fact that since the introduction of a fiat currency the swiss inflation rate has been 2% ,  2 . 2% in germany  ( ignoring post-war aftermath )  while in the us it has been 2 . 6% ?  in australia ,  under free banking ,  we got inflation rates of 2-5% .  the reference to voltaire is irrelevant - it is an empirically unsubstantiated assertion and engages in ad verecundiam  ( in any event ,  he is referring to printing money when people go into large levels of debt - which shows you have not answered my question: do you support debt-deflation ?  ) 
__label__0 non of the people belonging to the swiss establisment ever end up in jail .  board members should be liable for all the mess in the financial markets ,  corruption and arrogance .  but of course ,  the middle class will still be sending their kids to purchase useless acreditations which will help them socially and eventually cost dearly to "tax payers"  ( read "producers" )  . 
__label__0 when you have free trade with countries that produce an abundance of inexpensive products ,  you will export your money ,  jobs ,  and eventually your national identity .  don ' t believe me ?  look at those who have already done it . 
__label__0 free trade ?  really ?  where ?  the so-called  ' free '  trade is nothing more than free rape ! 
__label__1 sir ,  we have technology that will replace nuclear reactors ,  all you need is to replace the radioactive boiler .  the uncontaminated area can be reused as before  , saving billions of dollars .  this system: uses only water as fuel virtually no maintenance  (  this is not a hoax )  zero pollution  (  please contact us for further info )  produces as much if not more power than previous nuclear reactor

__label__0 thanks for that wisdom .  now have another budweiser and be happy with all the ignorance you have spread today . 
__label__0 it is laughable that mr .  hildebrand is trying to portray himself as a victim in this case; as is ,  to a fair extent ,  *the economist* .  it is clear that if this currency trade was actually a stock trade that both he and his wife would be facing prison terms for insider trading .  the spirit of the law has been violated but they have avoided criminality because they used a loophole to shield themselves .  *that* is why he had to resign ,  not because a central banker has to have ‘absolute credibility . ’ it doesn’t matter whether his wife made this trade or not ,  she clearly got the knowledge of what to trade from her husband ,  and they are *both* guilty .  are they giving the money back ?  no .  are they apologizing ?  no .  they are pointing to a right-wing vendetta that illegally sniffed around and found out these facts .  again ,  this irregularity ,  this loophole ,  could have saved them from criminal liability if this was insider trading of a stock ,  but that doesn’t change the facts of what they did ,  that is ,  work around the law for personal gain . 
__label__0 what will be done about blocher breaching banking secrecy rules ?  will he be investigated ?  was this information solicited from the bank employee or did he volunteer it ?  if someone does something similar to blocher now over some unusual transactions he can have no complaints surely ? 
__label__0 hhhhhhh  ,  it is ridiculous that someone like blocher could be faithful for his homeland and just did that to make it clear to the public  .  .  .  . any way i beleive mr . hilderbran was great in his career life and how he react aslo  .  .  .  but blocher  ,  if we want to talk about his "career" and "pure" life he has  ,  i cant understand how he still in politic life till now after all skandals he got about his business and affar  ,  just he bought people and things .  .  .  shame  ! 
__label__0 just another bureaucrat abusing is position .  out the door and good riddance . 
__label__0 hey ,  i am worth over 10 million ,  earn 1 million a year and will act like a nincompoop for a mere 50k .  .  .  .  nah ,  i don ' t think so .  the hoopla is over 50k and i think it was not an insider trade .  however ,  the man is a true gentleman in his behaviour and has decided to fall on his sword to save the chf from the shenanigans of the weltwoche and blocher muppets .  the best was the interview on sf1 last night that showed blocker lying through his teeth and roger koeppel looking like a cheshire cat that has swallowed the canary .  now they want the bundesrat to resign .  .  . excellent .  time to give that suicidal it chap some sodium pentathol and broadcast his interview on live tv to learn exactly what went on between him and blocher .  come on weltwoche - don ' t you want to ask for this clarity ? 
__label__0 how could family hildebrand have been so stupid ?  and yes ,  i am now expecting blocher ' s resignation as well ,  but i am not holding my breath . 
__label__0 wow ,  i bought a sh ! @load of euros in the summer too when the chf-eur rate was almost 1-1 .  thank goodness the feds haven ' t come smashing down my door ! 
__label__0 the eu sure made a mess of their member countries economies and will do the same in switzerland if given the chance .  look at the agreements so far .  .  . you can not raise a pig in switzerland unless you do it the eu way .  wake up switzerland before it is too late .  .  . 
__label__0 it must be truly acknowledged that today ' s well insulated economic situation in switzerland is due to the untiring efforts of the likes of mr hillebrand .  worldover ,  personal rapports built over a number of years ,  play a crucial part .  indeed sad that he had to go ! 
__label__0 notwithstanding all of the above he should have resigned ,  he did not have his wife sell the stock when he became aware of it .  i guess bankers have one set of rules versus the rest of us .  how many of us would get a years salary after resigning . 
__label__0 the solution to this is so simple: introduce a hefty land tax .  any idle buildings would have to come back into use as you have to discharge the land tax liability .  the way you do this is you let tenants in at affordable rates in order to discharge the tax ! 
__label__1 yet another historically-ignorant bigoted israel bashing propaganda piece from swissinfo .  not once in this nasty report is any  ' international law '  actually cited .  shame on you !  the delegitimisation and demonisation of israel on this website crosses the line into antisemitism .  and i refer to the european union agency for fundamental rights working definition of antisemitism .  swissinfo is opening itself up to legal action against it for deliberate lying about the israeli / arab conflict ,  specifically what is occurring in the west bank ,  and incitement of hatred . 
__label__1 and since the zionist aim is to cleanse the entire area of palestinians - one way or the other ,  they can talk until they are blue in their faces .  .  . no progress will be made because it doesn ' t suit the goal . 
__label__1 the fact is that the principal outcome of this ‘arab winter’ is the rise of the muslim brotherhood -- the anti-jew ,  anti-woman ,  anti-gay ,  anti-human rights body of jihadists that is currently making spectacular inroads into the western culture it intends to conquer and close behind them are islamists who are yet more extreme .  clearly ,  swissinfo wearing its shameless self-hating ideology on its sleeve is acting as a useful idiot appeasing the enemies of freedom . 
__label__0 great story .  to my shame ,  i have never heard the name augusto gansser before .  have to find out more about his fascinating life ! 
__label__0 prof .  ganseer is wel known to students of himalayan geology in india .  as a young geologist working for ministry of defense in 1967-69 i used his book with arnold heim the world famous swiss geologist and followed their observations along kali river western nepal all the way from dharchula to lipu lekh close to china border .  the rocks and contacts they marked were very true ,  it was the beginning of understanding the geology of himalayas for me .  i did not know that he had died until today when i read on wikipedia the birth and death dates of his .  it came to me as a shock but without regrets he lived a life well spent both as an adventurer as well as a geologist .  life of a geologist is too difficult .  perhaps to know more one may read the other book he wrote on throne of gods by him .  a . k . pachauri ,  ex professor iit roorkee ,  ndma ,  ministry of home ,  new delhi 110029
__label__0 this is typical of politics today .  unqualified people making decisions which will have massive ramifications on the financial markets ,  and they have no idea on the real impact .  it is simple economics that this tax would impact liquidity .  and to understand the impact liquidy has ,  all one has to do is look at what happened when liquidity dried up on the credit markets .  its a disaster of global proportions . 
__label__0 1 .  no one is putting a gun to the heads of any atp player .  no one .  2 .  no one needs to do anything other than self-regulating the amount of tennis playing or training ,  one can professionally do .  they are professionals ,  so they should know what they can or cannot do ,  without endangering themselves .  3 .  putting the blame on one person is so .  .  .  . childish and naive .  rf does not control the regulators or the rules .  he can perhaps influence them ,  but it is his choice .  4 .  is nadal trying to "shame" rf into doing something ?  he is badly mistaken .  swiss people do not take threats and have their own mind .  they do not need a spaniard or a brit or anyone to tell them how to think ,  or what to do .  5 .  swiss are not confrontational .  they prefer to do work slowly and steadily and see results .  going for the big bang approach ,  may win some matches ,  but then the body breaks down ,  and poor nadal cannot play football with his friends after he reaches 30 .  whose fault ?  not mine . 
__label__0 max- have you ever seen commandos or special forces organizations positioned as anything other than force projection entities ?  embassy guard duty is an interesting duty ,  surrounded ,  outnumbered ,  and outgunned by just about every entity in the host country ,  so the usual plan is to be low key and not attract undue attention .

__label__0 it ' s not just about the minumum wage but also conditions for worker in low paid jobs .  i recently worked in a hotel in zermatt ,  the owner was incredibly rude to me ,  sometimes the hours were ridiculous ,  basically you have to work more than the agreed hours .  the law needs to be tightened up here when it comes to low paid workers so that employers cannot treat them like dirt . 
__label__0 yeah money is freedom .  and all of us are slaves ,  time for another civil rights movement . 
__label__0 this is a social and political human rights subject that is the most easily abused , from the seekers side . with offering the best help to these seekers it makes me think where there is most a need for new immigrants .  that is africa .  africa has alot going for it at this time .  the fastest growing economies are in africa .  thats because they are starting at zero ,  but still ,  africa has a brilliant future in the right countries .  i think switzerland could offer better human rights to any asylum seeker , from any part of the world by making an agreement with an african country with a growing economy . 
__label__0 it is de dilution of ownership that creates problems .  .  . btw ,  a big factor here are pension funds .  .  . eliminate agents . 
__label__0 swiss citizens can also express their desires for fair wages by spending their money by this principle .  that is ,  choosing not to purchase goods manufactured in countries where the prevailing wage is 400chf per month and choosing not to purchase local services from firms paying sub-standard wages .  voting is nice ,  but taking concrete action is better . 
__label__0 i believe you are targetting the wrong sector there; shops like lidl work with a cost-saving formula based on having only a few multi-purpose staff ,  large franchise buy-in and standardised stores and only selling one of each type of product .  they stock quite some swiss and organic produce .  the dutch consumer organisation did a comparison between discounters and  ' normal '  supermarkets and found no difference in  ' ethical sourcing '  of products . 
__label__0 in such huge crisis  ( end of system ?  )  ,  very limited number of countries are in good shape and ready for the future  ( i . e .  population reduction ,  debt honoral ,  life level reduction ,  etc .  .  .  )  .  the world should observe these countries and adapt their own system to match them .  and guess what ?  switzerland is one of these !   ( usa ,  france ,  uk ,  italy .  .  .  are definitely not ) 
__label__0 history has shown time and again that the powerful of the world ,  be they kings ,  presidents ,  tyrants or ceos ,  do not release their power unwillingly .  nothing has changed .  a powerful elite exists ,  as it always has ,  and members are interested only in maintaining their positions of wealth and power .  they employ the services of us "little people" in order to ensure their own continued existence and place .  billionaires would not be billionaires if they had a social conscience ,  for no amount of charitable effort removes the obscenity of amassing such fortunes in a world where people die every day of starvation .  as long as our social structures allow wealth to be distributed unequally to the extent that it is and has been ,  it will remain distributed unequally ,  and there will be little justice or peace . 
__label__0 "there is no epidemiological evidence that salt intake is correlated with the prevalence of high blood pressure or that salt restriction will reduce blood pressure in young ,  normal individuals; indeed it is clear that in a significant proportion of people  ( up to 20% )  ,  the blood pressure may rise ,  sometimes alarmingly ,  if salt intake is reduced .  for this reason it cannot be assumed that the reduction in salt intake by a population as a whole is either reasonable or safe .  there is no evidence either of the efficacy or the safety of what appears to be the government policy of salt restriction in many developed countries ,  with the notable exception of canada .

__label__0 jo: when a restaurant is always full that means its guests like the cooking of the chef .  if you are on a low-salt diet ,  you may want to find another restaurant or cook yourself .  there are indeed a some places were saltier food is served to make guests drink more .  in the romandie beverages are cheaper and menus more expensive than in the germanic part .  this should explain why here guests rarely complain about too much salt .  actually ,  many add salt and pepper when the dish is served . 
__label__1 hi ,  i pleasured your web site . 
__label__0 bureaucracies quickly come under the control large corporations ,  and the bureaucracies then create rules and regulations to further the interests of these large corporations by creating regulatory barriers to market entry that punish small firms .  look at the health of the us population 50 years ago versus today ,  if creating massive bureaucracies made people healthy ,  the us would have the healthiest population on the planet .  leave the cheese alone and eliminate these bureaucrats '  budget .

__label__0 where their is smoke normallly their is fire  .  being in us reading all accounts of swiss banking .  no one in switzerland is ever done any thing wrong  .  how about pro active ways dealing with this problem  .  the waiter bring soup it cold  !  do you leave  ?  blame the customer  ?  send it back cover your eyes when returns ?  bring another bowl of hot soup  . 
__label__0 switzerland is a landlocked country so that means %99 of asylum seekers are entering from countries surrounding switzerland and since the asylum seekers first point of entry is another country such as italy , france , germany , austria  ( we all know they are all coming from italy )  then i would suggest that the swiss send them back to the first country that they landed on as per european union ' s own laws .  .  . and for god sakes tell your border guards to do a better job .  .  . problem solved
__label__1 @ra ,  switzerland: first of all ,  what do you try to insinuate with  ' my people '  ?  do not include me ,  as most likely the majority of the swiss citizens ,  as one of your people .  your comments certainly border on dewy-eyed if not naive ,  considering the serious problems most of the asylum centers are facing with the majority of the now thousands of pseudo ,  bogus asylum seekers .  since you seem to have no problems with these mostly young ,  healthy and evidently mainly arrogate and generally illegal ,  immigrants and all the answers i suggest that you to seek a management position in any of the asylum centers at the swiss border and find out what "they" the real world is all about . 
__label__0 get it over with .  it ' s just another kissing-up get-together and party by the leading capitalists and some questionable  ( including swiss )  government leaders .  what else ?  what has this wef and  ( linked bilderberg gang )  ever accomplished and achieved for the world population ?  they created the present world wide crisis !  who else ?  the coal miners ,  steel workers ,  carpenters ,  family farmers ,  butchers ,  machinists or the now billions of underprivileged ,  desperate and hungry  ' third world '  people ?  time to wake up and to see that this gloal downward spiral be stopped . 
__label__0 giving the imf money is akin to giving a drug addict drugs to cure himself  !  nuts  ! 
__label__0 another  ' deal '  behind closed doors in the making again by some swiss minister ,  now with the imf ?  why should or must switzerland support  ( finance )  the imf to bail out the eu out of their self-dug grave .  what else .  christine lagarde ought to knock on the door of the rothschilds and the royalties of europe first ,  before going begging inside the bundeshaus ,  aspiring to loot money away from the swiss citizens .  has the swiss government not knelt down to eu  ( brussels )  threats now for too many times and contributed  ( pumped )  hundreds of millions into the sinking eu battleship ? 
__label__0 europe certainly benefits from the stability that comes from oil flowing out of the middle east .  also ,  as one of the two largest political and economic entities on the planet ,  it is sad that the eu is forced to outsource it ' s defense whenever a conflict flares in the european theatre: specifically the breakup of yugoslavia and most recently libya .  until europe is capable of defending it ' s own interests without outside help ,  it cannot control the agenda . 
__label__0 don ' t be naive .  eu and us involvement in both yugoslavia and libya were about creating stability .  without stability you have atrocities and refugees .  where do these refugees go ?  to europe .  it appears your disdain for the us is clouding your objectivity . 
__label__0 @texswiss: your last comment just confirms your extremist position ,  one that seem to have clouded  ' your '  thought process and mind .  i have yet to see and confirm any evidence of stability in any of the countries that your heroic stability creating nation has intervened in over the past decades .  that includes the balkans ,  iraq ,  libya and of course afghanistan at this time .  are you possibly watching too many "rambo '  movies and relying on your national network news broadcasts to behest your opinion .  any clue what ' s going on in other regions of the globe ?  i suggest that you start to look outside your cocoon and learn about the other world ,  the facts ,  reality and the serious instability in many regions around the globe that was created by the  ' ruling power '  in many regions around the globe . 
__label__0 orca: apparently you and i are having two different discussions .  i ' m not defending the us ,  but rather advocating a stronger eu .  of course the us has made mistakes .  as long as the eu is too weak to counterbalance us power ,  there is no alternative .  just like in business ,  the lack of competition weakens quality ,  innovation and decision making .  instead of hurling insults at the us for decisions that have already happened and can no longer be undone ,  europeans should be looking to the future and pushing for more proactive involvement in africa and the middle east that are more in line with eu rather than us interests .  a planet with several equal ,  competing interests should yield better decisions .  look forward not back .  .  . 
__label__0 world cop or world ruler up to now ? 
__label__0 is switzerland a banana republic ?  doing the bidding of it ' s off shore masters ?  usa says bark ,  and the swiss howl .  give them the bank data ,  national laws be damned ,  change the laws retroactively to make it legal . 
__label__0 the swiss government - and any other country being pressured in such ways by the us - needs to tell the us to go and clean up in front of their own door !  it ' s funny how the us is pointing fingers at other countries whilst they got tons of unsolved problems in their own country that they should be taking care of .  the us got so many internal corruption problems ,  they need to occupy themselves with their own issues; that ' ll keep them busy for at least 50 years .  it makes me sick to see that countries like switzerland is bowing down to the outrageous arrogance of the us .  the us is not the world and not the officially elected and appointed world police ! 
__label__1 let ' s not forget that switzerland tried to do the right thing .  we tried to get the trucks off the roads by loading transit trucks onto the rails .  but guess what ,  brussels wasn ' t ok with that and forced switzerland to do their bidding .  now those same morons are complaining about the co2 emissions from our roads .  wonder where those come from .  switzerland tends to get things right if left alone .  no polluting gm food that would automatically increase pesticide use ,  clean water ,  good public transportation ,  not joining nato or other pro-war groups  ( hint to eu countries being praised: add all the pollution caused by your wars and your support for us wars to your co2 balance )  .  but as soon as the eu starts meddling ,  things go down .  switzerland needs to distance itself strongly from the eu .  we don ' t need a 3rd set of bilateral agreements .  in fact we need to repeal parts of the existing bilateral agreements .  brussels must not have control over swiss roads .  the eu must not import gm dirt into switzerland through cassis-de-dijon .  i don ' t have a problem with the eu countries ,  and even less of a problem with their inhabitants .  but the eu as an organization is corrupt and undemocratic to the core ,  and messes up everything it touches .

__label__0 asylum applications rarely have anything to do with humanitarian issues .  there are certainly examples where to repatriate an individual would be detrimental to their safety and wellbeing however there is a vast number of people who simply want to leave their countries and use asylum as a guise with which to enter the country .  switzerland should be presented with strong evidence that a person faces persecution in their home country before they are given the right to enter the country .  any less of a standard and they face being overwhelmed as has happened in places like france and england . 
__label__0 i do not see why europe should continue to take in asylum seekers from countries that are not at war .  it is understandable that people go to europe to find a better life ,  but now with the financial crisis ,  all that happens is these people end up getting asylum and then can ' t find a job and end up living on the social security payments .  this puts more pressure on tax payer and will eventually cause a lot of discontent .  asylum seekers should really have a valid reason for seeking asylum in europe and switzerland . 
__label__0 the whole debate is an interesting ,  yet somewhat useless one .  it does not matter where you go on this planet as an expat ,  the issues are always the same .  those coming in to the country have the duty to learn and adapt to the local lifestyle as well do their best to learn the local language  ( whichever it may be !  and if the language happens to be somewhat obscure or even "just" a dialect ,  then join classes  ( migros offer swiss-german lessons ,  just to name one )  or hire a private teacher !  )  .  it does not matter whether you are an american trying to make a living in switzerland ,  a mexican trying to survive in america ,  a polish doing your best to make it in the uk ,  or a dutch working in mongolia ,  the duty is on your side to respect the local populations ,  their customs and language .  local language and customs always seem odd and difficult to understand / manage when coming from another culture / language - but this difficulty should not stand in the way of your efforts to integrate .  and yes ,  local people do not always accept expats ,  but again ,  this is the same *everywhere* on planet earth .  it does not matter what the size or location of the country is ,  the problems are always the same .  i wish we expats ,  as a generic group of people ,  would stop whining about how hard it is to learn swiss-german and get on with it ,  put our heads down and do what needs to be done .  we do not lose our identity even if we do learn the local lingo and understand what ' s accepted and what ' s not .  quite on the contrary ,  we become richer as human beings . 
__label__0 good idea; here are other ones to learn for: 1-south africa has 10 official languages in addition to english; depending where you live your school will teach one of them  ( zulu , khosa , etc ,  )  ,  but all schools teach english ,  "the common national language" .  2- as a new immigrant to israel the goverment pays for you to go learn hebrew at special immigrant ' s language schools ,  to help you integrate into society .  i think it is the duty of any goverment to do that - it really works !  3-may be it should be compulsary that all swiss know all three languages well or that at least one of them ,  say german ,  is the obligatory one to know .  in this way at least foreigners can know that if they learn they will be able to communicate in any part of the country . 
__label__0 this is something new .  the familiar pattern here is xenophobia towards poor foreigners and sycophancy towards rich ones .  do i sense that the swiss are now struggling with how to handle the ordinary ,  employed multinational meritocrat whose skills and work ethic are making their neighbors feel insecure ? 
__label__0 "accept english as their common language" ?  oh my don ' t do it switzerland ,  you ' ll lose your culture !  no ,  instead of english switzerland should use the only language that is native to switzerland and that is romansh .  yes switzerland should have one official language ,  romansh and their canton dialect can serve as their second language . 
__label__0 high german certainly does count as it ' s one of the official languages of switzerland ,  and most swiss are taught in school in high german .  but that doesn ' t tell the whole story .  .  .  many of my colleagues are german ,  and quite a few think that speaking high german is enough .  they make no effort at all to even understand some of the more common swiss-german dialects .  i learned my  ( high )  german here in switzerland ,  and so have an "ear" for some of the dialects ,  and have on occasions had to translate from dialect into high german for such colleagues .  as a result ,  some germans appear arrogant to many swiss ,  something i can quite understand .  integration means making an effort at all levels ,  whatever your language skills ,  and respect for and interest in your host country .  rs
__label__0 for what on earth the residents should learn swiss ,  i could understand if one like to be swiss citizen he should speak the national language ,  it seems that swiss people are need to integrate into the 21 century ,  hey wake up we are not in the 16 century . 
__label__0 rampop: you should read again my comment .  by the way ,  how far do you get in the usa if you do not speak english or spanish ? 
__label__0 that ' s apples and oranges ,  you cannot compare switzerland ,  a country the size of west virginia in the middle of western europe surrounded and infiltrated by all the rest of europe ,  with the usa ,  a humongous country where most people are not even close to the border ,  with canada to the north and mexico to the south .  in geographically large countries this is what happens ,  not just to the usa ,  look at germany ,  france ,  australia ,  russia .  .  .  you *have* to speak the official language in these places to get by too . 
__label__0 when you are surrounded by language and culture ,  it makes it 50% easier .  it is not difficult to learn the language if you try .  get the pimsleur series ,  load it into your ipod ,  listen on the easy to work ,  in the evening ,  read in german .  i was teaching myself german when i was dating a swiss scientist ,  and i was in the us .  if i had had the luxury of being surrounded by the language ,  it would have been that much easier .  being busy is no excuse -- especially as a white collar worker -- to not learn the language . 
__label__0 frau sommaruga makes an incredibly ignorant generalization .  i doubt that there is a single english speaking senior executive living in swiss-german switzerland who wouldn ' t prefer to speak the local language and be well-integrated in their local community .  the reality is that virtually all multinational and high-tech companies are now standardized on english as their principal language for communication .  a manager in their 40 ' s or 50 ' s who spends their work days speaking and writing in english and uses english or a third language at home ,  and travels routinely to other business centers in asia ,  north america and europe where english is the lingua franca of business ,  will simply not become fluent in swiss german  ( and let ' s face it ,  swiss german is the swiss language frau sommaruga would like us to learn )  .  i know because i have tried ,  as i tried to learn cantonese when i lived in hong kong .  there simply isn ' t time or the opportunity to become fluent in a local dialect we might be exposed to socially a few hours a week .  our careers and our families are all consuming and frankly our brains are no longer wired for it .  my children go to a private bilingual school - the zurich city schools in our neighborhood are out of synch with the earlier-starting us and uk school systems and they are monolingual past the age when a ton of research shows their minds would have missed the optimal time for language acquisition .  they are happily learning german ,  french ,  mandarin and ,  yes ,  english ,  and will grow up to be the multilingual ,  multicultural citizens frau sommaruga wishes for .  the world is changing fast and it would be to switzerland ' s great advantage to embrace its access to global talent and accommodate the trade offs of a more international population ,  with greater acceptance of english ,  more flexible and bilingual public schooling choices for executives '  children and perhaps fewer unwelcoming remarks by its political class . 
__label__0 yes they do ,  but wales ,  scotland and ireland are separate countries and not part of england .  they also don ' t force foreign workers to learn their language  ( but the workers can if they wish )  .  english is an acceptable alternative .  you ' d think zurich ,  bern ,  basel ,  geneva ,  lugano ,  etc are all separate countries ,  given the way the swiss organise their system .  one language ,  one country .  the end ! 
__label__0 i don ' t understand all the vitriole .  i find the swiss are a delightful people ,  and despite the occasional offish remark from politicians ,  they are welcoming ,  kind and so helpful ,  especially when i stumble through my very badly formed french ,  and even worse german .  i ' ve lived in five countries and by far this is the best when it comes to welcoming foreigners .  and all that said ,  it is their country .  if they want us out ,  they should vote us out ,  but the truth is ,  economically ,  they need us .  and we love being here ,  but only as long as the welcome mat is out . 
__label__0 it ' s an interesting conundrum that places "who needs who more" at the heart of the debate .  cultural imperialism versus quid pro quo .  .  . 
__label__0 i still do not know why switzerland is subject to usa laws ?  maybe it is time to star releasing the names of some of the senate that have accounts in switzerland ,  monaco and singapore ?  maybe it is time to start releasing names of top us business men and women let the irs savage its own .  let the feeding frenzy touch us citizens now and then lets see how quickly this all stops .  it is wrong for the usa to impose its silly laws on another country ,  why do we put up with it ,  what is it that the usa holds over switzerland ? 
__label__0 move all bank holidays to a friday ,  then there would be no need to make the bridge and no need to miss out on a holiday at a weekend .  if the holiday is longer ,  either put them before the weekend ,  or make a sandwich out of the weekend ,  and take fridays and mondays free . 
__label__0 stress and holidays are not mutually exclusive .  one could easily comeback from a very stressfull holiday .  so in my opinion the main element is how to keep a less stressful  ( stressfree )  life and environment around us .  if each of us takes this seriously ,  we will have a better environment around us and it will continue to be fun to be at work ,  like it is for me . 
__label__0 not to worry .  they cut a whole load of their employee ' s pay by 10% last year ,  thus ensuring there will be plenty of loose change in the bonus pot so no executives will have to go hungry . 
__label__0 isn ' t switzerland supposed to be a neutral country ? 
__label__0 well let ' s see what deflation means for a small country as switzerland .  prices decreases ,  salaries not ,  profit margins decrease .  that means more "individual wealth" that will not remain 100% in switzerland ,  because imported goods will be cheaper .  so ,  at this point swiss products must become more cheaper ,  to keep trend ,  that means less profit at the same salaries .  ; )  at some point in time somebody will come and say: "we need to decrease your salaries or to fire some of you . " so ,  where is the "individual wealth" ?  the same reasoning for exporting goods .  sales will fall and swiss market will not be able to absorb all those products ,  that means close of business .  .  .  again ,  where is the "individual wealth" ? 
__label__0 @femke , switzerland: but we are all so compassionate and grateful about many of the millions of foreigners that were relegated ,  extradited and condemned to live in this inhospitable country under vengeful and hostile conditions .  i hope and trust that no chains were applied to keep you there in your case . 
__label__0 @lynx ,  switzerland: so you ' ve integrated very well "with other foreigners" in switzerland ?  what kind of integration into your "host" country is that ?  have you ever integrated with any native swiss ?  according to you ,  your living in switzerland on a much higher standard than in your country of origin is evidently your  ' way '  of integrating .  i doubt that you could be a loss to the swiss ,  considering your attitude and inclination . 
__label__0 is this a poor attempt at sarcasm intended to convey the message "if you don ' t like it why don ' t you go back to where you came from ? " such pitiful responses fail to acknowledge the unwillingness of the swiss to accept other cultures or really welcome non-mountain people into their community despite many of them bringing significant business and support to a country that would otherwise struggle to compete .  i think many visitors are already preferring france and austria ,  and reading of such unwelcome comments you will have to use third-party rendition and chains to get tourists to visit .  .  . 
__label__0 but do the portuguese reciprocate and treat foreigners so politely in portugal ?  i think not
__label__0 this comment is simply not true .  in my immediate family ,  we speak english ,  french ,  basel dytsch and high german .  some even speak italian .  yes ,  we are swiss .  i find the "undereducated" as you put it often make more of an effort to learn local languages than hot-shot executives who can ' t be bothered .  there may some resistance to learning languages in some pockets of ch ,  but as a swiss ,  it is highly unlikely you will find anything above a menial job unless you speak several national languages . 
__label__1 i am sorry to say it and i accept that there is good and bad in everyone  (  macca stevie w )  but having lived in many countries switzerland is incredibly unfriendly ,  returning from states and we are english ,  we dreaded it ,  laughter and public enjoyment are discouraged ,  ski resorts are the basis for most positive opinions ,  why ,  staffed by foreigners .  . unfriendliness and reserved attitude is passed off as culture .  .  .  . it is not it is selfish get out of my space behaviour  .  .  . if we could sell we would be gone .  . i will accept that swiss germany is better but no austria ,  regretably this opinion is shared by all yyour neighbours .  .

__label__0 that is really an idiotic comparison .  by now everybody knows that we have one of the most expensive health care systems on this planet !  nothing against this project .  however ,  it would make more sense to compare the cost with the amount an average family spends on food or housing . 
__label__0 both swiss living in the u . s .  and u . s .  citizens living in switzerland are being affected by this conflict .  to say ,  if you don ' t like it you can simply leave is ignoring the realities that many people face .  not everyone living abroad is a tax evader ,  a "deserter , " or a well-compensated executive on an expat assignment .  many of us are ordinary people with ordinary jobs ,  but we just happen to have fallen in love with someone who holds a different passport .  as an american in switzerland ,  i currently have the banking issues ,  but if we ' d relocate to the u . s .   ( which is easier said than done in this economic climate ,  especially if your career is not the type that lends itself to expat assignments and if you have school-age children )  ,  my swiss husband would have the problems .  where exactly do you suggest we go ,  lynx ?

__label__0 dr mo is right about today ' s definition of the word .  thinking about moon-fleet and the smugglers on the isle of wight ,  i came across an interesting definition: "but it appears that the original meaning of moonlighting was born out of the land struggles of the irish in the 1870s .  at that time most of the irish were poor tenant farmers who paid rent to farm and live on land that was primarily owned by the english gentry notwithstanding the fact that the land was in ireland .  an agricultural downturn and a severe recession prompted some irish to form the national land league .  the land league’s stated objective was to address the difficulties faced by the tenant farmers of paying their rents during the time of economic recession .  from this noble ideal arose the illegal acts of moonlighting .  moonlighting was the act of physical assaults and threats ,  arson and the maiming of farm animals .  when a tenant farmer could not pay his rent he was many times summarily kicked off his land .  secret societies ,  formed under the umbrella of the land league ,  began moonlighting .  the moonlighting was aimed at both the landlords and the new tenants of the land .

__label__1 switzerland suffers from folks like oskar freysinger who drag the entire country down .  in his new book oskar compares himself to heinrich heine because he as heine dares stand up to the "nazis" because hitler would not burn heines books ,  they were so great .  i believe that oskars motives in his constant attacks on muslims and his association with known racists and hate groups  ( he is on the board of a new group formed from other organizations considered by the anti degamation league as hate groups .   ( see sion formed from sioa and siao-ie different stop islamization groups )  underscores what europe has to say about switzerland .  oskar forgets at the same time ,  and i imagine to his great shame ,  that heinrich had this to say about islam .  .  .  .  on the spanish reconquista "on the tower [in cordova] where the muezzin called to prayer there is now the melancholy tolling of church bells .  on the steps where the [muslim] faithful sang the words of the prophet ,  tonsured monks are acting out their lugubrious charades . " for heine islamic spain -- here represented by formerly muslim cordova ,  reconquered in 1236 -- had fallen victim to "the dark tricks of history , " and the reconquista ,  far from being a righteous european triumph over an alien and expansionist adversary ,  marked a terrible cultural disaster .  the spain that emerged from her national victories was spiritually impoverished and intellectually desolate ,  filled with the sterile ceremonies of mindless catholicism .  spain ,  in short ,  was better off islamic .  the wrong side had won .  oskar would have branded heine as one of the nazis . 
__label__0 what is the objective here ?  "its the new form of communication that is blah ,  blah ,  blah" social media are growing extremely rapidly without the intervention of your employer .  why do they want to become involved with your social life ?  to encourage you to discuss work with colleagues outside the office .  or to encourage you to publicise the company you work for  ?  in either case it is self-serving and not as righteous as the web evangelists would have you believe . 
__label__0 some of the comments in response to this article leave me nonplussed .  it merely says that employees are great sources for engaging with publics . obviously ,  the strategy needs to be a c-level one .  what the article is trying to say ,  i believe ,  it is a requirement for a company to communicate and connect with their customers on social media because this is where the consumers are .  the channels have changed .  the debate is no longer about whether to be social ,  but how and where . 
__label__0 "social media" is nothing but a shallow ,  mind numbing way with which a very large percentage of our society is losing the ability for real communication .  teenagers can no longer spell ,  they can barely talk properly ,  they text to "friends" that they are about to go to the bathroom etc  .  the electronic back and forth babble adds nothing to the quality of life .  get together with family and friends over a nice meal and some drinks and a few laughs ,  that is what i call socializing .  i go as far as making comments on swissinfo . ch ,  no more .

__label__0 to me ,  it seems clear that the us created this foreign tax problem for itself by demanding taxes from it citizens no matter where they live or where they make their money .  it should not be considered a problem for the swiss to the point which they must change their laws to accommodate the us .  tell the us to change its laws and the us problem will disappear .  good luck if the swiss tried to get banking information on swiss citizens from the us .  the us is a well know tax shelter country and generally does not share information with anyone .

__label__0 hat: i tend to agree with your comment .  meanwhile ,  i have read the tribune de genève article and the point becomes a bit clearer .  minority groups  ( it mentions tibetans )  are worried that the chinese government may be tempted to use this institution to manipulate public opinion in switzerland .  don ' t most interest groups try to do this all the time ?  the majority of the citizens have a brain to think and determine for themselves what is right or wrong .  the chinese culture is very old and fascinating .  occasionally ,  i am inspired by the wisdom of laotse ,  confucius and the others .  .  . 
__label__0 @hat you are wise and right .  chinese is not a country poeple , but a race ,  covering most part of a continent .  "taking over " is a bit stronger word .  " communicate " "impact" would be more acceptable .  becuase nodoby like to be " taked over"  .  .  right ? 
__label__0 lynx: actually i am as curious as you are .  having gone through the pain of studying all these objects last sunday ,  it became crystal clear: casinos aye ,  all the others a big nay .  seriously ,  i have some doubts whether the holidays will pass .  many years ago there was an initiative to reduce weekly working hours which was rejected .  cynics then said that main reason for the refusal was the voters '  fear that our civil servants would be lacking sleep which is ,  of course ,  totally unfounded . 
__label__0 i would love to see a 35-hour working week ,  like in france ,  but if this ever came up ,  the swiss would no doubt vote for a longer week .  i have trouble finding enough to do for 42 hours ,  but then i work twice as fast as my swiss colleagues .  maybe that ' s the trick .  work slower . 
__label__0 there is never a "cheap" electric car .  the car is expensive and so is the power needed to fuel it .  good alternative is a diesel car which runs an electric motor as the main drive .  the diesel charges up the electric motor and batteries . 
__label__0 this is the first time that i have heard about manner . ch the media keep going on about womens equal rights ,  the world forgot about men and our rights . why didn ' t swissinfo do articles about manner . ch before ?  is it because it is not politicaly correct ?  since i have been in switzerland ,  i have noticed that there is no equality for men who are looking for work  (  i have been turned down by employers because they  ' wanted a woman '  )  ,  the swiss military service , paternity leave ,  etc .  it should be law for every canton to have a similar organisation such as manner . ch
__label__0 so ,  in other words ,  you basically gave up working when you moved to switzerland .  it is very difficult to have both a satisfying job and be a mother in switzerland .  of course ,  a large percentage of american women  ( read the article )  work part-time and do both successfully .  there are millions of jobs in the us that provide "mother ' s hours"  ( ie .  8 or 9 until 3 )  and the whole world benefits from having women in the workplace ,  including the children .  maybe your life was stressful in the us ,  but you should see how stressful it is for the mothers and children in switzerland when a mother works through lunch .  also ,  the children in the us have sports teams and dozens of clubs and after school activities that truly enrich their lives .  swiss teens smoke more than us kids and are out getting drunk legally at 16 years old .  your generalization no longer holds water . 
__label__0 i gave up working through choice ,  having decided that the welfare of my children was more important than climbing the corporate ladder .  my children here also have sports teams ,  music classes ,  plenty of after school activities that enrich their lives ,  that is not exclusive to the us or uk .  my point is that the children have the chance to come home at lunch time ,  get a decent meal ,  a bit of rest from the school environment before going back into quite a hefty workload .  when in the uk they would be exhausted by the time they came home ,  still with homework to do .  it was more difficult and more stressful working and being a mother than just being a mother ,  still trying to juggle child care ,  after school clubs ,  work ,  meetings ,  kids illness days ,  homework etc .  i could also work part time if i choose to ,  but i don ' t ,  as then i would still have to catch up with all the other chores ,  which still have to be done and that would mean less family fun time .  it is all a personal choice and each to their own ,  but i am a bit fed up of people saying how bad it is in switzerland for working mothers .  at least here i get the choice not to work .  in the uk and us i had no choice but to work due to the ridiculously high house prices and low wages .  the other thing i would like to point out is ,  at least here i am not looked down upon for being a stay at home mum ,  in the uk if you dare to stay at home to look after the kids you are deemed an unworthy second class citizen .  as for kids going out and getting drunk or smoking at 16 ,  that is a parental responsibility to stop ,  nothing to do with whether the mother works or not ,  and you should see the state of some kids in the uk . 
__label__0 as a man who has lived and worked in both countries ,  there is no comparison .  swiss men speak about women like my grandfather did .  much of what is said and done in the swiss corporate world regarding women would absolutely be shunned and considered illegal in the u . s . 
__label__0 the event organiser ,  megan beyer ,  wife of the us ambassador to bern - is it just me ,  or can anyone reading this see the irony ? 
__label__0 what gives with you and germany .  this is the safest energy ever .  no one in japan was killed by nuclear energy last march .  you need a european-wide policy ,  as others are building in your midst . 
__label__0 nothing to do with backing green causes ,  more to do with the type of lifestyle he leads while preaching to others about saving the planet .  the mans carbon footprint is several times that of your ordinary citizens but he has the nerve tell others to change their lifestyles ,  now thats what i call hypocrisy ! 
__label__0 all those steroids muct have gone to his head .  there ' s been no statistically significant warming for the last 17 years despite the rise in co2 .  that ' s not all ,  there was no warming from 1959 to 1976 despite co2 levels known to be increasing .  in fact over the last 52 years there ' s only been general warming for approximately 21 years  ( 1977-1997 )  and if you check the data closely temperaturs fell in many of those years compared to the previous .  the conclusion is inescapable - co2 emissions do not cause significant warming and if they cause any warming at all it ' s easily counteracted by other climate forces . 
__label__0 only someone comatose would not realize that arnold is self consumed and that for others he left destitution and fiscal destruction .  a tragedy for mankind if this is "somebody" . 
__label__0 this example is nonsensical ,  the property is already converted so there is no reason for the commune to lose any income ,  why would they ?  the only thing that can happen is that the commune might not be able to grow it ' s revenues quickly .  but what is more important ,  building new chalets in the mountains for rich foreign speculators and occasional holiday makers ,  or protect the environment ?  most people will agree with me rather than you ,  and as a brit i know exactly how rapacious the british appetite is to build property and damage green belt and the environment .  now sod off and build elsewhere . 
__label__0 i would like to send my deepest condolences to the families of the dead passengers .  are there seat belts for children in the buses ?  are there seat belts at all for the passengers ?  in long-haul buses ,  this is a mandatory requirement .  how was the condition of the bus and bus-drivers ?  i look for the results of the post-mortem and pray that nothing again happens . 
__label__0 busses aere new ,  seat belts present ,  busdrivers just started with the trip according to belgian news agencies .  no words for this tragedy ! 
__label__0 if you choose to abandon immigration controls altogether ,  be prepared for the flood of underprivileged ,  uneducated and culturally alien who will forever gum up your beautiful nation .  good luck ! 
__label__0 we ' ve got this gummed up situation now .  at least 173 have freely admitted to being here illegally .  so ,  at least 173 should be on their first flight home . 
__label__0 @wolf .  could you provide us with a verifiable source of your statement ?  switzerland was just named number 1 in infrastructure by the wef !  those tunnels save countless lives compared to crossing the alps on wet or icy roads over the top of the mountains .  additionally they shorten distances and as a result protects the environment better .  and at the end ,  human error or maybe a health problem caused the accident .  is there room for improvement in the design of tunnels ?  yes .  is there room in avoiding baseless statements: definitely . 
__label__0 all my condolences to parents ,  teachers and surviving children; having read the reports and watched pictures  ( especially the one with the niche ,  the wall and flowers ,  published in nzz )  and video  ( in this issue )   ,  i got the impression that ,  while the tunnel is a modern work of engineeering and the road-way well marked ,  the combination of a curve of the road and an emergency niche may have caused the accident .  especially the wall ,  at an 90 degree angle to the road is not clearly marked as the sides of the road are . 
__label__0 sincerest condolences to all the families and friends who have lost their beloved in this tragic accident . this is so sad and so painful ! 
__label__1 reading the swiss media today at least the good news is that  ' no swiss were harmed in the accident .  '  otherwise it would have been a real tragedy right ? 
__label__0 het is onwezenlijk dat door het noodlot zoveel onschuldigen getroffen worden door een waazinnige catastrofe .  uileg geven kan niet .  emotie en commoties zijn te groot .  kleine kinderen psychologisch gevat in een neerwaartse spiraal van onbegrip .  ouders en familieleden van alle slachtoffers hopeloos op zoek naar een antwoord op hun lijden .  ik voel mee met de rouw die u zo diep treft en de lijdensweg die nog te gaan is voor allen ,  een zware shock voor nederland ,  belgië ,  polen en duitsland . 
__label__0 rousian ,  i am talking about putting a barrier in front of the wall ,  not across the lay-by .  if necessary ,  the lay-by should be longer to enable this .  neither does the wall have to be at 90 degrees to the traffic ,  it could be at a shallow angle over a longer distance thus preventing a head-on situation . 
__label__0 when are people going to learn that any non muslim westerner is a kidnap target in countries such as yemen and the tribal regions of pakistan etc .  just because you are from neutral switzerland is no protection whatsoever .  anyone who chooses to go to these areas needs their head examined . 
__label__1 i rather read about people dieing alive  ,  than dieing myself . 
__label__0 i understand the swiss need to find excitement ,  having lived in switzerland for many years .  however ,  instead of seeking "life" elsewhere ,  why not make switzerland more fun ? 
__label__0 terrible that it has happens ,  but sometimes people need to wake up and realized that if you want to go to places where they toss grenades like a tennis ball or shoot randomly in the air for whatever reason and have some kind of stone age laws ,  don ' t expect yourself to be safe no matter how safe you think you are  (  .  .  .  )  hopefully this lesson can wake people up . 
__label__1 @sammy ,  the proof is in the pudding .  .  .  i think 911 and other incidents speak for themselves ,  no one has forgotten and they shouldn ' t .  muslims have to "prove" their trustworthiness .  even though there are good ones thrown in the mix unfortunanetly "the many have to suffer because of the few . " lets see what happens .  .  . besides ,  they can always go back to their muslim countries and fully live their muslim lifestyles there .  no ?  .  . and you as an american should be on full alert !  .  .  . lol
__label__0 when i heard the news about the sierre coach crash and read the accounts of the tragedy in the newspapers ,  i was moved to tears and i don’t cry easily .  any loss of human lives is tragic ,  but when it happens in such circumstances and involving so many children ,  it is particularly heartbreaking .  my thoughts are with all those families who lost loved ones .  one can only speculate ,  as to what caused this terrible accident ,  as at this stage it is still a mystery .  hopefully ,  the swiss investigators will come up with a conclusive explanation .  the truth of the matter is that the design of the tunnel ,  contributed significantly to the devastating death tool .  although the tunnel is relatively new ,  that particular section of the wall terminating abruptly at a ninety degree angle ,  it is not only a major design flaw but also shows a lack of forethought and an accident waiting to happen .  apparently ,  this is a common feature in all tunnels in switzerland .  if this is the case ,  perhaps the tunnel designers need to go back to the drawing board .  one doesn’t need to be a civil engineer or expert in tunnel design ,  to envisage all the potentially deadly scenarios that such a wall angle ,  facing the oncoming traffic ,  could lead to .  the wall should be slanted to an acceptable angle ,  through computer simulation ,  if need be ,  adequately illuminated and a crash barrier placed in front of it .  had it been designed in this way ,  the force of the impact would have been deflected and the coach rebounded back to the road ,  with no loss of life or significantly reducing that possibility .  lets hope that it won’t take more lives ,  to improve tunnel design . 
__label__0 genna ,  the reason whyi i had my first tokens because i was suffering from deep depression and anxiety .  i felt safer consuming marihuana than taking medication for i thought marihuana would not be as adictive as medications that treat depression and anxiety .  it turns out that marihuana is the only drug that is addictive in all three levels of addiction .  from my experience with drugs as a contious human being i would defenetly not endorse the legalization of drugs .  i would have a much more accountable government that will prevent the use of drugs as well as a proactive social i frastructe to rehabilitate effectively anyone who is struggling with addiction or any mental or physical disability .  drugs are not healthy even though it may take you into a state of deep contort ,  you must realize what drugs does toyour health and the consequences it has to society the economy and ultimately national security .  anything that causes an addiction is bad . 
__label__1 i ' m sorry you feel like you do .  i know you won ' t be alone ,  but equally there will be many others who enjoy the odd evening / weekend joint who claim doing so adds to their quality of life .  many would also dispute that cannabis is addictive  ( i accept mental addiction - especially regarding cocaine can be extemely powerful - well done for perserving )  .  remember ,  not everyone who has a hard time stopping has a supportive grandmother .  would you feel differently about your smoking if the activity wasn ' t so stigmatized and you had access to less toxic / potent strains ?  society could be reassured about a more liberally regulated drug policy if it spoke to those who have relatively normal lives despite drug taking  ( unfortunately a largely hidden population for obvious reasons .  see for example ,  http: /  / www . jrf . org . uk / publications / exploring-user-perceptions-occasional-and-controlled-heroin-use-follow-study )  .  as with everything else how well they manage varies .  the point is drug use and even addiction do not have to be the disaster you suggest - for individuals or society . 
__label__0 let ' s just hand out the most potent cocaine and heroin to the addicts for free and let them overdose ,  without any medical life saving  ' emergency treatment '  thereafter .  why do some countries like malaysia and singapore established the death penalty law for drug dealing ?  they certainly have not such serious health care problem as many of the "free" western world countries these days .  . 
__label__0 dr mo: what is now your compassion for the thousands ,  by now reaching hundreds of thousands around the globe of innocent human beings that are victims  ( killed )  in the interest of your non-self-inflicted drug users and their compassion ,  victims of the drug growing ,  distribution and dealing business ?  what ' s your compassion or interest in that area ? 
__label__0 it easier to destroy than to create .  saying "no" is easy ,  perhaps cowardly .  providing a new and effective solution is the mark of a creative and valuable approach . 
__label__0 fukushima ' s problem was catering for a 2metre sea but the tidal wave was much bigger .  does switzerland have that problem at mühleberg ?  some how i think not .  also note how many deaths occurred at fukushima - zero .  there ' s good reason to believe that the "safe levels" for radiation could be increased a thousand times without detrimental effects .  the swiss government lost all its commonsense when it decided to phase out nuclear power .  i feel sorry ,  not pleased ,  for the swiss people . 
__label__1 please let blocher end up in prison with a load of foreigners…
__label__0 if you want to play with fire ,  be prepared to be burnt .  i hope justice will prevail and the rich do not just get away scot free . 
__label__0 i guess for people like you who seek grandiose in everything bern will always be an embarrassment to the nation ,  after all there is no king sitting there .  or president with ambitions of being a king .  meanwhile ,  if you want to see a capital ,  which is truly an embarrassment to the nation ,  why not try washington d . c .  ?  with its crime rates and littered streets .  oh ,  and there ' s no international airport too . 
__label__0 eu officials should impose a 150 euros exit / entry fee in eu for swiss citizens .  if switzerland is doing great by not being in eu they can afford to pay the eu entry fee .  if they can not afford it than they should cut back on travel and stay home . 
__label__0 @eu citizen: if the eu imposed such a ludicrous tax ,  i think switzerland would react by sending all of the "eu citizens" home to work in their less profitable ,  less efficient ,  less social countries in the eu .  switzerland is successful because it is switzerland ,  and not spain ,  romania ,  france ,  or any other eu country failing economically right now .  try looking at what we do right ,  eu citizen ,  and maybe try to copy us ,  rather than criticize us for your failure . 
__label__0 or maybe we should forbid swiss people from going to doctors  ( especially dentists )  in germany ,  france and italy .  .  . i ' m sure that their wonderful health insurance system can pay for all their treatments .  .  .  i mean ,  if switzerland is so successful ,  then why do they go shopping in eu countries every week-end ,  have their teeth fixed in eu countries ,  live in eu countries and commute every day ?  there are more than 30 , 000 swiss people living in france ,  close to the border with geneva and vaud ,  and commuting every day .  .  . and being typically swiss ,  that is ,  always trying to be "smarter" to the detriment of the rest of the world ,  many of them keep their residence in switzerland  ( to pay less taxes )  ,  but use the public services of france  ( schools ,  free healthcare ,  public transportation )  .  .  . without paying for them .  this is a plain fraud .  .  . like the many ones perpetrated by your dirty banks .  if you are so successful ,  use your doctors ,  live in your little country  ( with an overheated housing bubble )  ,  shop in your supermarkets .  .  . 
__label__1 lynx ,  i agree with all your posts ,  just one tip .  do not argue with a fool ,  bystanders can not always tell the difference .  regards j
__label__0 with hopelessly distorted views such as these ,  i now understand why you have no swiss friends . 
__label__0 pretrial detention doesn ' t mean they are criminal .  just accused of a crime ,  so these figures don ' t count .  geneva lunch forum - who are they ?  how about quoting some real facts for a change ?  perhaps in geneva there are more foreign criminals ,  but what about everywhere else ? 
__label__0 ze - out of everywhere you have visited ,  which country is best ?  for me ,  switzerland ,  but it could be much better ,  especially the social scene .  i am just waiting for aliens to arrive from outer space .  only then might the world wake up to the fact that we are all from the same place ,  called earth ,  and stop all of this tedious fighting over land ,  religion ,  politics ,  language ,  etc . 
__label__0 lynx: that is an amusing comparison .  an army buddy of mine found the following citation in the old testament of the bible: "they wore strange clothes and did not know where to go" .  he was convinced that it refers to the swiss army  ( lol )  . 
__label__0 one of the reasons i moved east !  geneva is becoming a horrible place to live in .  .  . dirty ,  full of government and international organization employees and with the highest crime rate in ch .  thumbs up in "die schweiz" ! 
__label__0 i moved to central switzerland 2 years ago ,  and i ' m surprised and concerned about how open swiss are with their racism .  calling people jugos ,  swiss-only housing ads ,  the general attitude towards anything foreign .  switzerland is a rich country because there is an abundance of foreign capital placed here .  and a lot of it is "grey" money .  maybe less now than 30 years ago ,  but it still fuels the economy and living standards .  what i ' m most surprised about is actually how people in this forum deny the problem ,  and think svp is doing a good job with their rhetoric .  switzerland ,  you need to get a grip with racism . 
__label__1 i feel that the majority of the swiss just are acting selfish for their own benefit .  they do not care about poor people who want to succeed in the swiss economy because out of a society that values their own career and activities over others they only value anyone who has a ton of money .  what gives them the right to dictate who can succeed in their democracy or not .  if they have legitimate complaints then wait for the problem to get worse and then you can tell the eu this is why we would have voted to reduce foreigners . show the eu by saying i told you so . 
__label__0 haha .  this would include insulation from the us; seen the situation with swiss banks there ,  and the situation with us money in switzerland .  an additional problem is that from any part of switzerland you are in the eu within 1 . 5 hours ,  and switzerland signed up  ( afer public vote i would like to add )  to the schengen free-trade agreement; maybe a wall is an idea . 
__label__0 this eu new deals has all the components of the antique colonialism: accept my rule ,  no matter how good or bad is for you ,  or die .  they want to force switzerland to become another slave country of the european fiasco .  what they are not understanding is that as much the make pressure ,  the less people will accept their imposition .  we are returning to the time when any given power could just take over weaker neighbors .  instead of army ,  they have trade "agreements" .  i am sorry to say that the european union has proven to be ineffective ,  but these pesudo-politicians insists in selling a defective product without warranty ,  with known technical problems and without support .  sad sad move . 
__label__0 what hypocrites !  pointing the finger at others at every opportunity whilst attempting to cover up their own government sanctioned racism and human rights abuses . 
__label__0 lynx: you should really consider frank ' s advice to hire a fiduciary company to fill in your tax returns .  some have previously worked for the tax authorities and can recite the tax code during their sleep .  one extra benefit you get is that they cosign your declaration and the taxman will address queries directly to them .  my own experience taught me that it is money well spent . 
__label__0 here in london i own my home outright .  i am also lucky enough to have a modest chalet in zermatt .  however i would be heavily penalised if this is paid off .  another nice scam from the swiss gnomes . 
__label__0 gee ,  that has been really fast !  this problem has been known for the past thirty years .  the "quirk" works like this: when you own a home ,  the fiscal authorities calculate the rental value of your property  ( mainly based on the habitable cubic meters )  .  that rental equivalent is then added to your taxable income .  because tax rates are progressive this can make the tab expensive .  however ,  if you take maximum leverage  ( mortgages )  you can deduct the interest paid on the debt .  for those you do not know it ,  the idea of taxing the hypothetical rental income was invented by our social democratic party .  their argument was then to compensate for the unfair advantage that homeowners have because they do not have to pay a rent .  this simply illustrates their philosophy that the capital that you acquire through your hard work belongs to you only temporarily and you have to pay a "rent" for holding it .  .  . 
__label__0 that is rather surprising .  in her home canton  ( aargau )  she does not have many fans .  must be somewhat related to the click-off nuke power program .  .  . 
__label__0 don ' t worry hat .  if the swiss allow this ,  they will make the rules so complicated that most foreigners will give up long before they have ploughed through all of the red tape . 
__label__0 this may surprise you orca ,  but i agree .  why should switzerland clean up the mess caused by other nations ?  we need to put a sign at every border saying "sorry ,  we are full .  try next door" .  switzerland needs time to absorb its present high foreign population without adding more . 
__label__1 the idea of creating a rumour is not likely to suceed  ,  would be nice if it did  !  i like your comment about the real refugees during the two ww ' s  ,  they came to stay alive ,  the deserved the label " asylum seekers " what ch has to deal with today are pure and simple parasites  .  i do not understand how this situation has gotten out of hand to such a degree , considering that ch has the political means to affect change via a referendum .  who the hell are these people  ,  these do-goodders who are so enamored with fake refugees ?  i am at a loss  . 
__label__0 i had an idea the other day  ( just as another auto drove past me ,  while i am on the zebra crossing )  .  how about a personal video camera hat which i can wear at all times ,  recording these traffic offenses ?  i can wear it while i walk ,  and while i drive .  when i catch these people ,  i will send the video to the traffic police and they should give a fine or warning to the offenders .  if the police want to encourage this  ( i am not stopping the offenders ,  just filming them within my rights )  ,  they can even give me 10% of the fine money so that i can finance my video "hobby" .  i really think the bad drivers and pedestrians ,  all road users should be punished .  they simply do not know the consequences .  look at the recent bus crash .  driver error ?  we still don ' t know but we can guess handy-driving is not a good idea at all .  i see this everyday ! 
__label__0 failings of all swiss drivers: never indicate at roundabouts ,  turnings or junctions overtake on the inside on autoroute talk on mobile phones ,  incl bus drivers drive too close and go in safe distance i leave between cars drive too close behind approach junctions too fast drive too fast on country roads over take when it is not safe to do so etc etc etc no wonder insurance is so high and accidents so so frequent where are the police monitoring this or is it easier to issue a speeding or parking fine  ?  if police policed junctions for a week and fined all those who fail to indicate ,  others would soon take not .  do this country wide ,  patrol the motorways ,  country lanes etc and the safety would improve exponentially . 
__label__0 i eagerly await the outcome of this panel .  i am very sure "justice" will prevail .  it only depends whose justice it is . 
__label__0 a five ton decline vs 195 , 000 tons shipped seems minor ,  particularly in view of the eu financial problems and the overall malaise worldwide .  rather than a  ' problem child '  i assess it as sustaining itself rather well .  i ' d guess that shipments by truck show a relatively equal decline . 
__label__0 instead of worrying about cleaning up space ,  why don ' t we take this money and clean up the streets of zürich ,  bern ,  and basel to the standards of the 1970s ,  where you had to search all over to find a cigarette butt or paper cup on the ground .  switzerland did little if anything to contribute to the "space junk" problem .  let the us and russia ,  along with the esa ,  worry about their own mess . 
__label__0 it ' s outrageous to call state officials who were doing their duty "criminals" .  the job of german tax officials is ,  among other things ,  to hunt down tax cheats .  the criminals are the people who are stashing their illegal money in swiss accounts ,  not the people who want to bring them to justice .  unbelievable accusations from switzerland . 
__label__0 i belive that transparency becomes an issue when a party proposes draconian changes to our justice system in the name of transparency .  the svp and oskar freysinger in particularly continue to advocate that the justice system release the nationalities of those in conflict with the law .  oskar freysinger said specifically that dies must be done in the name of transparency .  the svp spent 41 millions only on advertising in the past few years .  i would love to know where this money comes from ,  if for no other reason that to be reassured for the security of my country .  people who give money often attach strings and who knows the nature of these strings . 
__label__1 i miss the old site and as yet have not become accustomed to the transition
__label__0 the new website is an attempt to fix something that was not broken in the first place .  i visit the site often and i found the old layout very pleasing ,  with one story in the focus and the others following .  the new site has a huge image ,  that when looked at from a laptop makes you have to scroll before you do anything else .  please at least consider making the image smaller .  thanks for your time . 
__label__0 hi all ,  swissinfo is a very important communication channel for me and i access the site in a daily basis .  thank you for keeping us ( foreigners )  informed about important matters happening in switzerland .  keep the good work you ' ve done so far !  regards ,  lucy
__label__1 please can you put the popular readers ' feedback on the front page again ?  there is room at the side  ( for maybe 10 latest comments )  ,  under the reuters news feed .  i quite enjoyed seeing what people thought but now i have to go into every article to keep track of this .  also ,  from experience of my own website ,  readers don ' t like to scroll down ,  so ,  if you can ,  please try and fit the latest news on one screen .  finally ,  the photo on the big news item is too big .  have you checked out wordpress web layouts ?  that ' s what my company uses for its websites . 
__label__1 re: swiss info: i don ' t do face book or twitter ,  and i don ' t know what exactly rss feed is .  how can i just continue receiving swiss info by e-mail  ?  please let me know .  thanks .  paul kessler
__label__0 there is no theological basis for restricting ordination to men or to unmarried persons .  time to give up the traditions of misogyny and of celibacy .  they are chokeholding the church and killing it slowly by stubbornness and blinders .  the rest of the church is suffering from their weddedness to unnecessary policies . 
__label__1 dear swissinfo ,  is there a list available of household products and personal hygiene products that contribute less to this microbiotic build up in our lakes ? 
__label__0 now it is clear .  one might add that during the 1950 ' s many married women stopped working when the first kid was born .  still others worked for the family enterprise  ( farms ,  bakeries ,  butcheries etc .  )  but their contribution was not considered statistically relevant at that time . 
__label__0 shame these postings don ' t have a time attached .  all of my postings are after working hours or during short maximum half-hour lunch breaks  ( i don ' t have time to take 2 hours )  .  i generally do a 60-hour week ,  having a millionaire swiss boss too miserly to employ another person to help .  but i get long flexi-time holidays to compensate ,  but no extra pay ,  so i can ' t go anywhere and when i get back my inbox is full again ,  so it ' s quickly back to the 60-hour week .  sheesh  !  !  !  ! 
__label__0 thank god .  the swiss need a rest ,  no one else has been able to keep up .  viva la suisse
__label__0 i do differ in opinion .  if you need a certificate from betreibungsamt about your records and i you have stayed in 2-3 gemeindes even in the same canton ,  you need to go to each one of them and pay chf 17 . - each .  and the bank asks for original of that certificate .  in modern age ,  what does an original of such a certificate mean ?  it just says that these things are not availabe in network even in a private manner . 
__label__1 i wouldn`t shop at aldi or lidl ,  all the money goes back to the krauts ,  i support swiss shops so that jobs stay here ,  mostly foreign bludgers go to caritas . 
__label__0 as a tax payer contributing to the salaries and livelihood of swissinfo champagne socialists ,  i am compelled to complain about this neo-marxist claptrap .  this article really takes the biscuit .  .  . or should i say lentil .  .  . or mung bean .  .  .  .  .  . for the wanton ,  arrogant and patronising sentimentalisation of the poor ,  redolent of the same smugness that was rampant among the british victorian upper and middle classes .  here ' s the best line:  '  ' people with a low level of training – who are therefore more exposed to the risk of poverty – are more likely to suffer from obesity because they cannot afford a balanced diet .  when someone’s budget is already reduced to the bare essentials ,  he is much more likely to buy rice or pasta than fresh produce .  '  '  .  this nonsense is not only blatantly mendacious but also offensive . 
__label__0 james: with the common man you obviously mean yourself .  had our finance ministry and the snb started to act in 2007 to prevent this crazy run on our currency ,  many companies would be still alive and running .  to fully restore our economy the franc would have to be devalued  ( or debased if you prefer )  by at least another 25 per cent .  inflows of hot money is about as welcome as gadflies whom we do not hesitate for a second to kill them . 
__label__0 swizt .  it is high time that your people have a really good look in the mirror .  your nazi past keeps coming back to haunt you-it was never given a good burial .  the world watches your shame . 
__label__0 the roma are a problem all over europe .  however ,  because of schengen ,  it is difficult to control their free movement .  the solution is simple - get rid of schengen and stop them coming into the country instead of constantly bleating "woe is me" via the media . 
__label__1 the only incitement here is from the roma themselves with their criminal record . the weltwoche is a victim of political correctness . 
__label__0 you started the article with the correct question "why is this necessary or good" .  i didn ' t notice the answer to the question in the article .  just because "it can be done" doesn ' t necessarily mean it should be done .  we have the same problem here in the u . s .  we have mature technologies looking for an application .  does this mean that citizens should necessarily be intruded upon just because the technology esists ? 
__label__0 i can and i do take the train .  one of the driving rules is don ' t drink and drive ,  so when i go out and want alcohol ,  i take the train .  if i am with friends and i see someone reading ,  out of respect we sit somewhere else .  any children with us are told to keep quiet ,  out of respect for others .  if i sound frumpy ,  i apologise .  i actually have a reputation as a very happy ,  jolly ,  person ,  at work ,  socially ,  in relationships .  if i come across as otherwise ,  whose fault is that ,  doug ? 
__label__0 i agree .  swiss service is rubbish ,  yet the image abroad is that it is the best in the world .  this is why swiss hotel schools are full of rich foreigners paying at least 50 , 000 chf a year for their education .  i feel sorry for these students who expect the best and get the worst value for their money .  smokers can still smoke ,  but away from everyone else .  in a land obsessed with integration ,  this is exactly the opposite result . 
__label__0 most restaurants do not make an effort to win clients . many people prefer a fast food place on friday evening instead of a proper dinner .  the fast food restaurants actively market their products ,  good or bad they win customers .  the association of traditional restaurants should try to win new customers ,  especially little ones .  gastrosuisse should make efforts instead of complaining about taxes .  admit that it is not taxes that make the food expensive ,  100 chf dinner will not be any cheaper if it were to cost 98 chf .  win new clients .  . aggressive markets ,  like coupons etc .  . 
__label__0 if u live here then u should learn one of the languages ,  the swiss are very tolerant ,  americans should change the school system introduce more language from an early age
__label__0 this may be being "relatively well received" by the statists in washington ,  but the only reason the rest of the country isn ' t up in arms about it is because they don ' t know about .  beyond that ,  it is truly sad to see the once proudly independent swiss nation kowtowing to uncle sam . 
__label__0 this is quite astonishing .  switzerland abolished the totally secret accounts  ( savings booklets made out to the bearer )  in the late 1960s while they remained freely available in austria until the eu forced her more recently to scrap them as well .  some things really do change .  .  . 
__label__0 because the strong frank even now killing the swiss economy and swiss companies .  .  . 
__label__0 migros and coop charge inflated prices for imported goods ,  and products made with imported materials - like yogurt and cheese made with imported fresh & powdered milk .  what do they do with their huge profits ,  since they don ' t have shareholders who get dividends ?  inflated bonuses for their bosses ? 
__label__1 because if you are not swiss ,  you must prove that you you what even money is . 
__label__0 why happens this: very easy i think that in the 70% of the cases is because our system based on money ,  and money is the problem .  stress in work ,  chomage ,  crisis ,  poverty  (  80 millions of poor people only in europe  ) 
__label__0 orca ,  your comments implied that the swiss have become lazy ,  which is why the foreigners have their jobs and why swiss standards have fallen .  go and look again at your comments . 
__label__1 swatch co-founder hayek was born ,  the second of three children ,  to a lebanese mother and a lebanese-american father .  secondo  (  ( maggi )  maggi war das jüngste von fünf kindern eines italienischen einwanderers aus der lombardei , 
__label__0 switzerland is a christian country ?  ?  on the contrary ,  it is about as thoroughly secular as a country can get .  fewer than 10% of the population bothers to go to church .  i would say it is even anti-christian  ( during the evening news on good friday ,  tsr ran a particularly insulting piece on prayer ,  making a mockery of christianity and other religions )  .  whatever christian roots this country may have had ,  they have all but disappeared now .  i ' d rather the cross be taken off the flag since the majority in this country have turned their backs on god . 
__label__0 trouble is ,  the swiss do exactly that .  one foreigner is bad ,  therefore all foreigners are bad .  one person from one country is a criminal ,  therefore all people from that country are criminals .  until we change this mindset ,  there is nothing we can do to change swiss opinion .  perhaps the next generation will be more accepting ,  since they are growing up with foreign children .  we can only hope . 
__label__0 no ,  kindergarten and primary-school children to not need to be offered information they are not asking for .  if they do ask ,  parents are in the best position to know what is age-appropriate ,  and what their children can handle emotionally .  "educators" may be able to provide the how ,  but not the why .  parents can ,  and are entitled to do both .  they should know what they are talking about since they produced the child in the first place . 
__label__0 unfortunately ,  the television has become a baby-sitter .  most children have computers and televisions in their rooms .  most have mobile phones .  if not ,  they are ridiculed by their friends for not keeping up with them .  how many children do you see playing outside nowadays ?  very few compared to the pre-internet days .  porn is the most searched for item by children  ( if their parents don ' t control what they can see )  .  they grow up believing that porn is the real world .  they need guidance from a professional ,  not a parent ,  as to what is real and what is fiction . 
__label__0 personally ,  i can ' t see why a national health system wouldn ' t work here .  it ' s only a small country with a population of less than london ,  for example .  this system failed in some other countries because it got too big to manage .  if they ran the system like car insurance ,  with a bonus for those who don ' t claim ,  then it would greatly benefit those who are never or rarely ill .  it should also be run by the government ,  not thousands of insurance companies with high salaries and costs ,  which i am paying for .  medical rationing can be open to discriminatory abuse .  will a swiss be treated before a tax-paying foreigner ?  will the rich get treated before the poor ?  will a child be treated before a pensioner ?  will a white person be treated before a black one ?  most of us pay insurance .  we are entitled to the same treatment . 
__label__1 lynx ,  it ' s time you study basic math and logic ,  lol
__label__1 dear max: has it not yet occurred to you that lynx has a serious problem with the swiss and switzerland in general ?  i will refrain from ever responding to any of his comments .  they are undeserved ,  in vain and a waste of time . 
__label__0 @dj: i stand to be corrected on the following; as far as i know the safeguard clause enacted here allowes switzerland to refuse people from these countries working permits .  however ,  under the schengen agreement ,  that the swiss have signed up to ,  switzerland has agreed to allow people from the schengen area and people who already have legal access to another schengen country free access into switzerland .  the perfect scenario for people to be employed illegally . 
__label__0 i commend the swiss for being bold enough to take this step .  they ' ve been talking about it for some time ,  and since the trend keeps growing they have no option than pulling this temporary handbreak .  it ' s also understandable since the safeguard clause is part of the treaty .  besides ,  majority of the swiss are against eu immigration .  please tell me: should the government listen to the eu or to its people ?  at the end of the day ,  we ' re talking about national interest ! 
__label__0 swiss neutrality at work again .  either have quotas for every country ,  or have quotas for no country .  why pick on e .  europe ?  these people are some of the friendliest i have ever met . 
__label__0 i have no objection to anything in the media .  but the sentences in your comments are not in so good taste .  ex1: there is no real need to provide any reason ex2: it is switzerland belonging to swiss people .  it is not a country belonging to any eu or schengen grouping  ( then why allow schengen visa ,  because tourists in schengen visa will travel less to swiss because of another visa )  ?  ex .  3can we say "we do not like these guests" ?  yes we can . 
__label__0 it ' s total bs what this alpine country seems to be doing .  restriction of people ' s right ,  secrecy policy on embezzled funds and the abuse of international law is a call for concern . 
__label__0 switzerland belongs to the swiss people , period . schengen was and remains a very big mistake  ,  combined with political correctness  ,  it ' s a nightmare .  i like your comment a lot . unfortunately there are way too may do-gooders in ch  ,  common sense has no chance against them .  personally ,  i see only doom and gloom for ch  ,  what a shame  . on the other hand  ,  i am old enough to avoid having to witness the destruction of a once great country . 
__label__0 your friends probably learned french at school in england ,  which makes integration so much easier - one language .  i don ' t despise the swiss  ( except the intolerant ones )  ,  and i respect their culture .  i live in the swiss-german part .  i too have friends from swiss-french and swiss-italian parts  ( including girlfriends )  .  i have had many great times in both areas .  my swiss-german friends are those who have lived abroad and come back ,  who have great respect for foreigners because they have seen what it is like to be one themselves .  i know german and some italian  /  french but ,  unfortunately this is not enough in swiss-german land .  because i don ' t speak a dialect ,  i am not accepted ,  despite having swiss nationality .  maybe i ' ll force next swiss-german i meet in england to speak one of the dialects e . g .  scouse ,  geordie ,  mancunian ,  cockney ,  etc to see how they like it .  maybe then they will understand that one language  ( not a dialect )  helps everyone . 
__label__0 hey there !  i’ve been reading these comments and the article and i must say i’m stunned by the hypocrisy !  i’ve been send to switzerland for 3 months by my company and before i came here i had this idea of switzerland being the best country in the world to live in .  however ,  i realised very soon after my arrival that there isn’t much to love about switzerland or it’s people .  i find the swiss arrogant ,  prejudice and narrow-minded .  i’ve lived in few countries in my life and ,  to be honest with you ,  i’m counting the days down to leave this place .  mainly because it’s the most boring country in the word !  even the poor people from the 8 “banned” countries don’t want to come here - as is indicated in the statistics on this website: “immigration from the eu-8 saw 4 , 700 people move to switzerland between may 2011” and “the majority of new arrivals are germans  ( +12 . 6% )  ,  followed by portuguese  ( +11 , 1% )  ,  kosovars  ( +8 , 9% )  ,  french  ( +4 , 4% )  and eritreans  ( +2 , 6% ) ” .  as a protest against swiss hypocrisy and scapegoating i’m going to boycott swiss products and i won’t spend another frank in this country !  i planned few trips around switzerland in the coming month but i will go spend it in the beautiful italian or french alps !  if you agree with me join the protest ! 
__label__0 switzerland is a beautiful country to explore .  get yourself a guide book and a general abonnement rail pass and go and see this country in all of its glory .  you will find that most of the swiss you meet will welcome you ,  as long as they think you are a tourist .  however ,  be warned ,  as soon as you say you live here ,  expect some negative comments .  not from everyone ,  but you will get some .  especially in remote  ( swiss-german )  areas with little contact with the outside world ,  particularly if you have darker skin than them .  it ' s a shame ,  but that is how it is and until you change this mindset ,  little will improve .  for example ,  i was once in a swiss-german bar chatting to a barmaid .  she complimented me on my excellent german for an english tourist .  i said i lived here .  end of conversation .  do what i do when visiting new areas - say you are a tourist .  it ' s better . 
__label__0 1 .  the currency trading has not been shown to be illegal .  hildebrand was faced with having to prove a negative ,  relative to his wife ' s currency trading ,  which is difficult to do .  2 .  the person that stole the data ,  is a thief .  3 . blocher and the people’s party cantonal parliamentarians are in the role of the get-away car driver when something is stolen .  4 .  if they drove the thief and the stolen goods to the police ,  they did the proper thing 5 .  if they drove the stolen goods to somewhere else  ( weltwoche )  ,  they are as guilty as the actual thief .  it will be interesting to follow how this plays out .  it may give get-away drivers a whole new defense .  they can call it the "postman" defense . 
__label__0 and so the tax war continues .  people should be taxed where they live and where they work .  they are using the resources of the country they are in now ,  not where they are from .  don ' t the countries currently hounding their nationals abroad have anything better to do .  they can ' t be that short of money . 
__label__0 maybe this is a form of economic warfare but even so ,  ubs has been it ' s own worst enemy .  as they have essentially forced swiss abroad to look elsewhere for banking services ,  it ' s a bit rich to now moan on about losing market share . 
__label__0 ironic how it is always the lower and middle class incomes that carry society by paying the most tax and seeing their spending power diminish even as salaries increase .  they say switzerland is a true democracy but how can you call it that when our society is starting to resemble that of the usa ,  where the rich are the politicians who don ' t want to see their hard earned money go to taxes ,  but guess what ,  the lower and middle income people don’t want that either .  rich people should start paying higher taxes in order to alleviate the burden placed on the lower and middle class incomes . 
__label__0 every year ,  i complete those wonderfully complicated tax forms in mega high german that few swiss understand .  then i go to my clever tax accountant who manages to shave off at least 2000 chf from my calculations .  i have no idea how .  so ,  150 chf spent to save 2000 chf is definitely worth it . 
__label__0 i think you confuse two ideas here .  you compare 100% honest with  ' clever accountants '   ( ie ,  avoidance schemes )  i don ' t think the two fit .  someone can be 100% honest and use a tax avoidance scheme .  there has in the last year been this huge push to pay taxes on the basis of morals .  this is complete rubbish .  who ' s morals do we use ?  how much is a fair amount ?  is an isa an avoidance scheme ?  is having a company to administer personal affairs right ?  we as tax payers can only ever pay the tax asked by the government .  avoidance schemes are 100% legal .  people are entitled to use them and should .  why should we pay more to the government than is required ?  do you go to a shop and pay more for a bar of chocolate than is asked for ?  no ,  you pay the lowest amount of money required .  there is no  ' moral '  argument surrounding the payment of tax .  none whatsoever .  how can there be a moral argument to pay taxes so that your money  ( that you earned )  can be spent by a largly incompetent government elite on wasteful schemes that have lost the public billions .  i beleive there would be a moral tax arguement if there was proper allocation of tax resources ,  and the government actually cared about society .  i don ' t see any of this .  what i see is the government being reckless with our money .  it is very much like a petulant child with daddy ' s credit card .  in relation to my own affairs ,  i have never believed that disclosing financial details is right .  just as i believe that medical records should be kept secret .  what i will tell you though is that i do not have an avoidance scheme on tax and i pay literally 100% of what is due of me .  i will always make the arguement for lower taxes ,  and i may become very vocal about the removal of personal liberty through unjustified taxation ,  but i will always pay what the law requires .  if i eventually find it too much i will simply move . 
__label__0 "swiss free-market economy reveals its bright side" fixt it for you . 
__label__1 i ' ve got news for amnesty international .  the swiss government has rights .  coop and migros have rights .  and what they do is none of ai ' s business .  who do these cocky little pc multicultural bullies think they are anyway ?  they are losers and misfits , suffering from arrested development ,  in an adolescent resentment of authority and success .  they are allying themselves with a belief system that walk all over human rights , an ideology that does not recognise freedom of speech ,  freedom of conscience and equal rights for all before the law .  their juvenile philosophy is that the enemy ( islam )  of their enemy ( capitalism and liberal democracy )  is their friend .  the only people who take these goons seriously are fellow travellers like swissinfo who of course just love these holier-than-thou hypocrites .  birds of a feather .  in the meantime ,  if coop or migros allow headscarves ,  i willtake my custom elsewhere . 
__label__0 so every country should lose it ' s identity to minority migrants ?  i don ' t think so !  people who come to switzerland need to adapt their customs to fit "within" the swiss culture .  we ' ve tried the politically correct way here in australia and we just ended up making islamic ghettos that the rest of the folks don ' t want to live in .  we should all be inclusive ,  courteous and kind to migrants as they bring many benefits but that doesn ' t require changing the swiss landscape or cultural identity . 
__label__0 i have no sympathy whatsoever ,  when the entire muslim community apologise for their radical extremists and how they have destroyed the freedom ' s and liberty we in the west enjoyed pre 9 / 11 maybe i will care about what clothes these people wear .  .  .  (  .  .  .  )

__label__0 too funny ! 
__label__0 could swiss industry also help england ?  there is a drought there too .  a bit embarrassing for an island .  but this is mainly to do with business being interested in short term profit rather than long term quality service .  this can be applied to every industry & country worldwide ,  where standards have fallen . 
__label__0 i think you misunderstand the concept of globalisation .  it has nothing to do with government rule or the blending of societies .  it has to do with the increased rate at which trade barriers are removed in favour of promoting choice .  it provides us with products from all over the world and allows the sharing of beneficial technology .  it is a trade concept ,  not a governmental or social concept . 
__label__0 "with the systems used so far in electronic voting trials citizens cannot verify if their vote has been registered and counted correctly" .  that also applies to votes sent to the commune by mail .  to make e-voting workable ,  all it takes is adequate data protection on the server and a modern secure data transmission protocol .  there are enough good examples for online commerce and e-banking .  writing the program is certainly not a job for amateurs but there should be enough engineers around who know exactly what they are doing . 
__label__0 on average ,  only about 30% of the swiss vote .  so can we fix the e-system so that every non-vote  ( electronic or otherwise )  gets recorded as a vote for me ?  imagine the power - english as the national language ,  drive on the left ,  national health service ,  more tax for the rich ,  less tax for the poor ,  no schengen ,  no drugs ,  etc ,  etc .  i could have a lot of fun recreating switzerland .

__label__0 well ,  maybe they will get the "blang" after the bling .  according to the first analyses ,  the markets are willing to give hollande the benefit of the doubt - at least for a short period of time .  if he does not come up with convincing  ( and long time necessary )  reform plans things will not change for the better .

__label__0 mr .  jones clearly would hate to look at the continuously good performance of the swiss economy as the tyrannical edifice of anti-democracy known as the eu collapses .  .  .  so he and those of his ilk would love it if switzerland jumped onto their sinking ship before it finally hits the bottom of the ocean . 
__label__1 dear sir ,  i am mr . sandeep falle from india . i have been suggested to refer you by marc rudolf ,  managing director ,  greater zurich .  o . k ,  now i want to give you a great news that i have found a chemical which if we add in fuels like petrol or diesel for vehicles ,  then we can get double mileage of what we are getting without it .  for example ,  my motor cycle mileage for 1 ltr .  petrol was 45 kilometers .  when i added that chemical in 1 ltr petrol and then got 88 kilometers .  thatmeans mileage is almost twice .  that chemical manufacturing is very cheaper and we can have it at extremly low rate .  i have tried and experimented many chemicals since many years ,  now i have got what i was expected . i am not scintist or chemical expert but i have experimented many things for this achievement .  i havenot told this thing to anybody here . i know very well and have fear that here in india ,  the big persons will snatch my idea and they will tell that this is their invention . frankly speaking ,  i don ' t trust here in india and noone will give me any royalty or any money or anything for my invention . but i can trust swiss people and government .  if you wish to take trial of my experiment ,  then i can show that to your person in india .  and if he is satisfied then if you support me ,  then we can apply for patent also .  it is a miracle .  i really wonder how i could got it .  you have many chemical and automobile analytics and expert in swiss .  i can tell them the chemical composition and then they can difinately do more better than me . as of now ,  this chemical is a miracle and if we add this to any fuel of any type vehicles ,  then we can definately get double mileage .  anyway ,  as i have suggested you i can give trial to your person in india  ,  plz let me know your interest .  my mobile no is + 91- 9890883118 ,  i am living in city- pune ,  state- maharastra .  you can call me anytime .  o . k .  , that ' s all for now ,  i am waiting for hear from you soonest ,  thanks a lot and best regards ,  sandeep s . falle
__label__0 i started reading this article thinking that the leader of this company was concerned about the risks of greece exiting on the holidays already purchased by customers not being honoured by bankrupt hotels .  oh no ,  it is simply indicating that the company intents to profiteer on the misfortunes of the greek hoteliers who may no longer be paid agreed rates in euros if the greek currency collapses and a cheaper option arises .  how opportunist is that  ?  i ' m not impressed by this behaviour . 
__label__0 the strong franc ,  the onslaught of outsourcing offshore ,  the high salary range ,  the wish for more family or own time ,  all contribute to this .  the schooling system and childcare systems  ( or lack of it )  also encourages women to stay at home and many claim unemployment insurance payouts .  switzerland is a perfect place to do part-time work .  part-time work is sometimes even encouraged when the firm has a manpower budget constraint .  it is a good thing .  who wants to work til he is burnt out ?  not me . 
__label__1 it ' s time to sell swiss back to the people of switzerland and bring back swissair !  !  !  or just transfer the companies world head quarters where corporate taxes work i ' m favour of the corporations .  frankly there will always be competition for clients and clients will always side cost effective services . 
__label__0 can anyone tell me which country ' s mafia is not in switzerland ?  i ' ve met members of quite a few during my time here . 
__label__1 for me as a citizen of canada it makes me laugh the absurdity of canada being involved .  the reason being is because canada does not care of the well being of it ' s own citizens in canada or abroad .  the canadian government  ( beurocrats and aristocrats )  impose the shut up and dont complain that we don ' t care about you my dear patriot meanwhile the canadian government is putting their nose in the welfare of a non canadian citizen .  i ' m glad to hear that mr .  chen is in a better state of life now however it makes me sick to see that the government of canada got involved ,  the canadian goverment should have not been accepted to join the party as they say .  frankly canada is sudomasochist nation where canadians are starngled just to the point so they can grasp a very minimal amount of air to breath unless you are part of the corruption than theses people have more than enough energy and courage to tell non beurocrats to shut up and not complain that they are beingexploited by its own government .  here in canada animals are treated better then its own citizens .  it is a real shame and failure to have had accepted country that lacks human rights in it ' s own country to be involved in something so humanitarian .  it frankly makes me very angry to read that canada was involved in this affear .  canadian beurocrats should take a reallity pill ,  wake up and look at them selves in the mirror of how foolish they look . 
__label__0 well lynx ,  lol !  ,  i had to writte all that for people to understand what i mean without allowing the benefit of a doubt .  people must be informed properly .  thank you for your idea of forming a political party for swiss abroad however it ' s to late cause i ' m moving baack to switzerland soon .  i have all the power in the world for my mind allows me to understand everyone without discrimination .  my philosophy is that individuals must be proud and patriotic without compromising universal and global rights .  many here in canada offer me to run for prime minister however here in canada people are not patriotic and therefore i would not run for primeminster of canada because i would not allow the benefit of a doubt to occur .  switzerland in the other hand people swiss people are righteous and courageous willing to do anything for their freedom and the freedom of their fellow patriots .  patritism is key for freedom and sovereignty of a nation . 
__label__0 i hope that switzerland today hasn ' t changed so much from what you remember so that you turn around and return to canada on the next plane .  everywhere i look ,  the swiss are being forced out of their homes by disrespectful ,  noisy ,  foreigners ,  who are behaving a lot like cuckoos kicking chicks out of their nests .  maybe it ' s a deliberate tactic so they can form their own country within switzerland ,  with zero integration .  i saw the same thing happen in england and other countries ,  with the governments there doing nothing to stop it .  looks like switzerland is going the same way ,  unfortunately .  it ' s not a paradise any more . 
__label__0 well lynx you need not to worry any longer .  my grandfather always fomented and tested my patriotism and my grandmother always tells me that i should go clean the streets ,  i thought she was insolting me calling me inept to do other kinds of work however now i understand what she means .  when i get there i will clean the streets of every corner of my home and i will keep it clean as it suppose to be any dirty national and foreigner will tremble when they see my broom .  i invite you to join me in geneva we will clean our nation together and all others like us . 
__label__0 lynx ,  my perception of you has changed .  i was wrong to jump to a conclusions of your character .  you frankly sound like a true swiss and i would have no problem giving you my trust .  thank you for not crapping on my country .  we the swiss have been continuesly persecuted and we have managed to stay unified thanks to the courageous charter of people like you .  personally i want to thank you and all others like you ,  thank you !  : ) 
__label__1 it is absolutely fair  .  you are not swiss u have no right to vote .  u choose to live here  ,  you have to pay taxes simple .  anyway non -swiss are lucky to pay the same taxes as swiss ,  in my opinion they should pay more after all they have so much money  ,  afford 10k houses per months international school ,  permeant holidays they come take swiss jobs and complaint that is unfair u should look at other countries and how they treat their exptats look at dubai and then compare ! 
__label__0 some foreigners come here with zero intention of integrating .  they have usually run away from their own countries ,  seeking life in a rich country with high social benefits ,  while keeping their own culture and language .  many swiss areas ,  for example ,  have become eastern european or african ghettos .  i sometimes have to ask myself which country i am in .  when i applied for swiss nationality ,  i asked if i needed to do a german test .  the office staff laughed and said my german was better than most applicants ,  and i consider my german to be terrible .  despite this ,  i am now swiss . 
__label__0 where is the problem ?  you break the rules ,  you leave .  easy .  now ,  if we could only do the same with swiss criminals ,  then switzerland might return to the paradise it once was . 
__label__0 living in one of the newest eu member states ,  i would just say "keep away from eu as much as and as long as you can" .  for countries like mine eu membership ,  as well as joining nato ,  was and ,  maybe ,  still is a matter of survival .  for countries like switzerland ,  one of the very few remaining countries in the world with definitive sovereignty and quality of life principles and rules ,  such associations could be disastrous .  sticking to swiss customs and traditions will be impossible under eu jurisdiction .  swiss way of living is worth prevailing and if i were to raise a dilemma it would certainly be one facing the eu nations with their intimate desire to join the confoederatio helvetica ,  and not vice versa . 
__label__0 i know very little of switzerland and the eu but i can ' t see swiss independence as a bad thing for the swiss .  they seem to have everything to lose and not much to gain .  i wish we could have a democracy even close to switzerland . 
__label__0 switzerland needs to remain separate from the eu as much as possible while striving to also retain open access to the markets of its neighbors .  the strength of the swiss is it ' s independence and self-determination .  and if it ' s independence is diminished or surrendered to the eu as a result of bilateral accords - then don ' t accept the accords .  in the long run ,  freedom is more important than trade . 
__label__0 rouslan ,  you are absolutelly right .  i would even ad that most of the eea countries became dictatorial "democracies" .  i left my country ,  an eea member ,  in 1986 and i have been more time away than in my country ,  i don ' t own property there or financial interests and just a month ago i went to renew my passport in the consulate and a couple of weeks later i receive a letter from the tax office from my country asking me to declare my income !  when since 1986 i only go there to see my parents ! 
__label__1 so why the hell swiss claiming democracy and keep all thieves money in their bank . leave middleeast then they donat come there

__label__1 the us has declared economic war on switzerland .  the us is very vulnerable given its debt load and the role of the us dollar .  if the us persists in this war on switzerland ,  the swiss government should announce that all swiss financial institutions will be prohibited from purchasing any us dollar denominated securities ,  and current portfolios will be "liquidation only" for us dollar assets .  also the snb will no longer hold any us dollar holdings and be selling it all .  this will mark the end of the us dollar as the global reserve currency and the end of this constant bullying by the most hypocritical regime in the modern era . 
__label__0 totally agree with all the posters so far .  i have numerous times pointed out the pro left and pro government stance of this website .   ' isolationist '  is the tactic being used to label anyone that is against the eu .   ' isolationist '  is what keeps switzerland out of the dirty business of other countries .  if only more countries would try it we might all get along much better .  after reading the  ' for '  and  ' against '  sides ,  my wife is definitely voting for anything that pushes the eu further away ,  including this initiative .  judging by the amount of propaganda ,  flyers etc in the streets ,  the against side definitely is using a lot more resources . 
__label__0 yes ,  but the swiss are more intelligent and look ahead .  it is not like the usa who knew about the levy problems in new orleans but did nothing about them .  the swiss take precautions .  .  . 
__label__1 i assure you ,  the entire israel will now stop sleeping an night knowing that another bigot has joined its boycott .  and ,  fyi: palestine is the name of a roman province ,  which then became a part of ottoman empire ,  and finally the territory under british mandate in years 1917-1947 .  there was never an arab country named "palestine" ,  no matter how much you sympathize with its cause . 
__label__0 whilst the death of eight dolphins in switzerland is regrettable ,  the action taken is in no proportion to the bloody slaughter of thousands of dolphins ,  particularly by japan .  action by switzerland against japan ,  denmark ,  peru etc would achieve a great deal more . 
__label__0 as you discuss this development the franc has not been this weak since 2008 .  the snb ' s alignment with the ecb has caused the franc to more than mirror the euro ' s decline in value .  the snb is destroying swiss wealth as well as its banking community .  did swiss citizens vote to become members of the eu ?  if not why is the snb pursuing this policy ? 
__label__0 dear max ,  sorry if i did not make myself clear .  but yes you are right .  i was talking evolutionary-generations of time .  all languages are competing with one and another ,  evolutionary .  people with common backgrounds are more likely to gravitate towards each other  ( balkanization )  due to various factors  ( in this case being language )  .  the reason why one language is spoken in a common area  ( except when global trade is done )  is because it works most efficiently .  more resources has to be put into a society that has multiple languages ,  etc .  multilingualism is simply a "passing" or "transition . " in today ' s modern era ,  it is enforced by hedonistic liberals to relish their fantasies ,  in flowery language of "progress , " without understanding the consequence of their actions over the long term .  liberals cling to a egalitarian fantasy that languages will just be equally important and be "together in harmony" until the end of time .  essentially ,  certain languages are dying or becoming extinct .  a "weaker" language is one that not used as much ,  and thus ,  so slowly dies out ,  generationally ,  and is replaced by a more aggressive language that has more usefulness .  the "stronger , " or shall i say ,  "one with one with more advantages , " eventually overtakes the other one simply due to easiness and practicality  ( its usefulness for survival in everyday life )  to the given population .  assimilation of a "weaker" language often comes ,  by taken certain words / phrases / etc ,  but the language itself is essentially dead .  a dead language is not used ,  and is not passed on .  or is passed on to fewer people until it becomes non-existent .  it offers no practical benefit in everyday life ,  except for the occasional vacation or stranger into your homeland that is not a native speaker .  what constitutes a "stronger" or "better fit" language ?  various factors .  a larger population that utilizes the language fully in everyday life ,  brings into all facets of life ,  will overtake other languages deemed not necessary to survival .  some factors you mentioned like "ease to learn and speak it ,  phonetic attractiveness" are true as well .  a language only survives through preservation .  otherwise ,  the language best suited for survival wins out .  if you don ' t use it ,  pass it on ,  preserve it via separation ,  you lose it . 
__label__0 the more languages one knows the easier it is to learn or appreciate a new one .  words or expressions that were familiar e . g .  50 years ago are getting lost or replaced by new ones that are often misspellt or used in the wrong context .  i believe it would be of cultural value to consider retaining  ' the old words '  and preserve the uniquesness of the swiss language and its dialects . 
__label__0 how would you learn swiss-german when there is no standard ?  which dialect would you concentrate on ,  the local one that is spoken in one town only .  i don ' t see a way around learning standard german . 
__label__0 even if i wasn ' t from gb ,  or another english speaking country ,  i ' d still campaign for one language for all .  it doesn ' t have to be english .  the swiss constantly complain that the foreigners don ' t integrate ,  but keep putting barriers in our way to stop us ,  such as multiple languages ,  such as the need to speak at least 3 languages at work ,  such as the swiss germans insisting we learn their multiple dialects as well as german .  luckily i didn ' t need swiss-german to get swiss nationality ,  otherwise i ' d still be a foreigner and not paper-swiss .  now i can vote to change things ,  but as i live in the middle of a svp stronghold ,  my vote is generally wasted . 
__label__0 i totally agree with andre; i also come from south africa; many times i have given the same "11 languages" example to swiss people &amp; experienced the same problem in geneva on a recent business trip .  the swiss should have 1 official country language ,  say german  ( since the majority speaks it )  ,  so if you move or emmigrate then at least you know what language to learn to be able to socialize ,  integrate into society &amp; work nationwide . it ' s simply unfair for the swiss to complain about "foreigners lack of interest in integration" when they don ' t try themselves to do that with their own swiss compatriots ! 
__label__0 max: i agree that mine should be the general point of view of most of romands .  i ' m not dreaming anymore about swiss germans changing their main language to high german as most are so proud about their local dialects and don ' t like germans .  i was mostly asking what can we do in this situation as i think there is no solution while we don ' t want english and swiss germans want to keep their local dialects .  then there should be a third solution but i don ' t think it might happen .  i wouldn ' t mind german being the only official language in switzerland as is mandarin in china for example ,  but i think swiss germans loathe this idea even more than romands .  in this case why couldn ' t be french the official common language in switzerland  ?  it ' s a rich language ,  worldwide spreaded ,  and even if it ' s more difficult to learn than english ,  i think the main reason is that swiss germans just don ' t like it because of the sound or the jealousy i don ' t know .  i think it ' s a wrong preconceived idea that most of french speakers think their language is the best .  french really is one of the richest language in the world and thus said ,  we like it ,  but we also value other languages ,  when it ' s not local dialects ; ) 
__label__0 the author here has no idea what he or she is talking about .  this is a perfect example as to why western civilization is failing on multiple levels .  you cannot "preserve" multilingualism  ( or multiple languages being equally spoken in a common area )  .  eventually there becomes a balkanization or assimilation / extinction .  but this idea of egalitarian principles is absurd . 
__label__0 exactly .  these so-called  ' demonstrators '  are narcissists and totally self-absorbed .  they are also apolitical ,  have no social responsibility and are quite indifferent to human suffering .  their minds are small and their cause is  ' me '  . 
__label__0 these delinquents are protesting for their right to abuse their bodies with alcohol and drugs ,  annoy and disturb people who need to sleep ,  and to trash their city .  they should all be arrested and sent off to a boot camp for re-education . 
__label__0 all rights and no responsibilities .  totally self-absorbed and self-centered .  thoughtless and disrespectful of others .  no higher aspirations in life than hedonism ,  to get drunk and high .  if this represents the future of switzerland ,  we are in big trouble . 
__label__1 it could be interesting to analyze why you have such a high level of drug addiction in the city ,  or porn stores  , would it be for the repression  ?  or for mentalities that are not alligned to the xi century  ?  please  .  .  .  meditate  !  !  !  !

__label__0 the swiss medical lobby at work again .  medical costs are so high because they know the swiss will pay  ( via extortionate insurance )  because they have no choice .  unless it is prescibed by a doctor  ( who you must also pay )  ,  medicine bought anywhere isn ' t reimbursed ,  which is a bit unfair ,  especially since those that buy their own medicine are reducing the waiting time for other sick people to get help . 
__label__0 true ,  the snb has no other choice but continue to intervene .  otherwise the franc would shoot up like a rocket and our central would have to book a massive loss .  the 300 billion foreign exchange reserves  ( representing almost 60% of our annual gdp )  mean that a colossal amount of speculative franc positions have been built up .  as several international experts have mentioned ,  there is one way to stop this avalanche: an emergency decree that prohibits non-residents  ( including banks )  to hold francs .  after a grace period of two weeks any illegal holdings should be subject to a flat penalty of at least twenty per cent and automatically converted into euros .  some banks would not like it but the average citizen thinks that we have too many banks in this country anyway .  the chinese do not have our problem because their exchange controls are very efficient . 
__label__0 why not do what china is doing ?  recycle the paper into gold bullion reserves .  as the ongoing currency war continues ,  the price of gold in all currencies will increase . 
__label__0 jammo: i really enjoyed reading your comment !  there is just one flaw in your theory: inflation .  it is typically caused domestically by excessive disposable income ,  i . e .  the consumers have too much money to spend on too few available goods and services .  the country also imports inflation when the currency is depreciating .  the bulk of the 300 billion francs that the snb printed is ,  so to say ,  sterilized because hidden in vaults and under mattresses outside our country .  if our central bank indeed created 65 billion a month ,  as you suggest ,  at one point in time the supply would exceed the  ( speculative )  demand and thus provoke a rapid devaluation of the franc .  it is hard to predict whether it takes one or several trillions to reach equilibrium .  however ,  you can bet that our politicians would become very nervous before we got thus far .  the money printing by the snb cannot be compared to the quantitative easing done by the usa because it does not serve to finance public deficit spending . 
__label__0 funny how these resorts don ' t drop their price to attract more people .  look at the news guys people are looking after their money !

__label__0 why don ' t i leave ?  i am a natural born critic .  if switzerland was perfect ,  then i would get bored quickly and leave .  so ,  dj ,  if you want me to leave ,  fix your country .  easy . 
__label__0 priceless ,  "there are many cities around the world that would love to host the international crowd that geneva does . " exactly ,  this is the only positive side effect of these souls looked down upon making a living by stealing in geneva ,  that the whole international crowd leaves .  their bullying is done with ,  the despicable attitude something of the past .

__label__0 the crime levels in geneva are sky high .  i ' ve witnessed more crime  ( & unfortunately been the victim )  here in under a year than in many years living in london & la .  the police are completely ineffectual .  people say that geneva is a big city & so we should expect these problems .  no ,  it ' s not .  it ' s basically a large town !  there are large gangs of north africans all over the city committing crimes unimpeded by the law .  this place doesn ' t feel safe . 
__label__1 i have made the mistake of my life by thinking ubs is a reputable swiss bank , depositing all my money ( $350 , 000 )  to find out all my money gone by simple fraud  . the worth part my account manager admited directly it was his mistake by transfering the money based on fax wwithout getting my aproval but the legal department refuse to return the money . although they are fully aware according the swiss banking law the bank is fully responsible for the security the force me to go fto court . i have to teach those people a lesson . who can help me about it ? 
__label__0 asylum seekers never run away to poor countries .  switzerland needs to say "sorry ,  we are full" and forget about the opinion of the rest of the world .  someone needs to make a stand ,  before these people drag switzerland down to the level of the country they left behind . 
__label__0 please don ' t confuse immigrants and asylum seekers .  many immigrants come here at the request of the swiss to work ,  so they should be given the chance to apply for nationality if they wish .  but ,  i agree with applying your rules to asylum seekers ,  many of whom are using "asylum" as an excuse to find a better life .  at the end of the day ,  unless you can trace your roots directly to the original helvetic tribe that created switzerland ,  everyone in switzerland can be classed as an immigrant .

__label__0 be glad for how well the swiss health system works .  in the us ,  costs have doubled over the same 15 year period ,  as well as i can discover ,  and are at 17 . 3% of the gross national product .  plus we have very bad behaviour by insurance companies against the older and less healthy ,  highly raised rates and very high deductibles  ( e . g .  $5000 / yr deductible )  .  no fair play . 
__label__0 this is a very important topic ,  in political terms .  the word "fascism" gets thrown around a lot ,  but few know that it means the control of government by corporations .  in english speaking countries ,  democracy is professed as the political system ,  and as a causa belli ,  but fascism is what is actually practiced .  there are no death camps ,  but the government is absolutely controlled by large corporations .  that isn ' t even a radical or controversial statement .  even school children can see it .  and people working at night ,  and on weekends ,  so that corporations can make greater profits ,  is evidence of that fascism .  in practice ,  if the law favors large corporations above small family businesses ,  then you have fascism .  in switzerland ,  which actually has democracy ,  the law does not favor corporations over small family businesses .  so families have weekends together ,  and lunch together .  the law supports this ,  because the people still make the law .  the rest of the world ,  except for the owners of large corporations ,  looks at switzerland with admiration and envy .  small people everywhere dream of having small businesses ,  but the laws in most of the world do not allow it to happen .  in australia ,  where i was first trained as a lawyer ,  it is widely held that in order to survive as a small family business ,  you must break the law on a daily basis .  you must cheat your taxes ,  or you go bust ,  often before you have even begun to trade .  that was my own experience ,  also .  the entire system of common law and westminister representation favors large corporations ,  and destroys family businesses ,  and hence also the family unit .  you end up with class stratification ,  with mega rich owners and the working poor .  switzerland is not a great country because it bans trading on sundays and at night .  switzerland is a great country ,  the greatest country ,  because the citizens have the right to favor the family unit over the corporation ,  and to favor the individual human rights over the balance sheets of fictitious entities .  as time passes and globalization connects the entire planet ,  switzerland ' s legal and political greatness will be increasingly recognized across the world . 
__label__0 my question in the first place is ,  why is there existing laws ensuring closure on sunday instead of saturday  ?  is there possible influence here from the catholic church  ?   ( which ,  by the way ,  had the original day of worship changed from saturday to sunday )  . 
__label__0 night shopping isn ' t a problem some shops are already opened long enough and i don ' t work but my husband always has to rush out of work if he needs something before the shops close .  i guess for the average worker it might be a hassle because no one gets home before 6 or 7 .  on sundays it isn ' t really a problem because we have a convenient store close by if i need something in an emergency .  or the airport is always open . 
__label__0 businesses should be free to set their own opening hours .  as it stands ,  even in switzerland there are some exceptions to the sunday trading laws .   ( there have to be ,  really .  ) 
__label__1 to editor ,  please errrase my comment i thought twice after i wrote my comment .  nor post this request ,  please and thank you . 
__label__0 the costs are quite marginal and we can reduce the misery for people we consider citizens ?  great !  germany and the usa just got this one wrong .  this is well feasible .  so why should we not do it ?  we ' re still very far away from "exhausting" our ability to provide aid ,  anyways . 
__label__0 swiss has become mainly a quality label over the past three decades .  many swiss brand producers / providers were acquired by foreign companies and the buyers still like them because the products fully meet their expectations .  it is undeniable that foreign top managers and owners of swiss companies have a natural tendency to impose their own culture and some of the swiss staff may resent it .  however ,  any company that wants to be successful needs talented managers and if it cannot hire them locally it has to find them abroad .  what swiss citizens really dislike is when the staff in direct contact with clients does not speak the local dialect or language . 
__label__1 mrs . chantal ,  you didn ' t mention that glencore is owned by marc rich  ,  i think thats an important issue .  . 
__label__0 the problems of growing old will place an increased burden on the state ,  possibly an unsustainable one ,  whilst companies are fleeing their responsibilities wholesale .  final salary schemes have not only been closed but some companies in switzerland actually converted existing final salary schemes to fixed benefit schemes .  in addition these larger companies have taken to making people in their fifties and sixties "redundant" with no attempt to retain them ,  severely undermining the retirement plans of many decent hard-working employees . 
__label__0 if the demonstrators have it their way  ,  switzerland should take in all people from anywhere in the world who are seeking "asylum "  ,  meaning a life without work and lots of entitlements  .  insane  ! 
__label__0 there are probably more comments ,  however swissinfo blocks comments . 
__label__1 http: /  / youtu . be / qteq3kycmpo mr .  negasi the x-police has exposed the prison condition and the systematic killings of many innocent youngsters in eritrea by the authorities unlawfully .  as a result more than 5000 young eritreans are fleeing out of the country each month .  sophisticated manipulations ,  abuse and killings are the works of the dictatorial regime in eritrea .  this is a story that comes when the swiss government is changing the asylum law due to the overflow of immigrants to this country .  obviously the burden is heavy ,  but provisional permit decision is not the solution and it is not new for eritrean deserters either as it existed since many years .  there are many eritreans who requested asylum in switzerland in the past years and still living with a provisional permit  ( f permit )  .  having f permit has its limitations .  subsequently ,  the suffering still continues .  .  .  .  .  .  re-evaluating these decisions may help to alleviate some of the sufferings of these refuges .  putting an asylum seeker in a provisional permit resembles like attenuating a bacteria in a jar so that it will not be active for many years .  this creates more problem than it solves ,  it will not be helpful either to the host country or to the person who requested asylum ,  especially for eritrean refugees .  no one wants to end up as a refugee ,  leaving his profession ,  job ,  family and all his happiness behind ,  unless otherwise there are real threats and humanly unbearable situations at home .  hence ,  swiss authorities may interfere in this precarious situation of eritreans and help to save the lost souls of eritrean refuges .  with best regards ! 
__label__0 it depends on what kind of "growth" we are talking about .  growth in human development ,  achieved through increasing education ,  psychological and social services ,  and other types of human interactive activities that don ' t entail people buying tons of stuff to be happy is the type of growth we need to foster . 
__label__0 yes ,  i think that it is possible ,  but you have to be wary of claims of green technology insofar as that a lot of people don ' t factor all the pollution created .  in addition ,  at what point will replacing an older product break even economically and ecologically ?  if i build a new car quite a bit of pollution is created making it no matter how green it operates .  what upgrades give you the most bang for your buck whereas improving the environment ?

__label__0 orca: no ,  i live indeed close to the west-east axis that is not much better .  it is not "my" tunnel and i would also prefer that all the transit traffic would happen on piggy-back .  for the moment it is no more than an early idea to a project and a popular referendum cannot be excluded .  the saint gotthard is a vital connection for our ticinese compatriots and they suffer when it is completely jammed because of too many drive-through vehicles .  apparently the introduction of a tunnel toll is being considered but it is unclear whether it would have a significant impact on traffic .  the experience with the heavy vehicle tax seems to indicate that it does not . 
__label__0 @ pete: your word in god’s ear .  your suspicion that the additional capacity will be used eventually is legitimate .  the fact of the matter is that public opinion changes over time ,  else switzerland would neither have ratified all those bilateral accords with the eu nor count as many foreign residents as we do now .  we also know that the neat that some citizens initially considered a crazy and over-sized project will not solve all future traffic problems if the need for mobility continues to grow exponentially .  the idea of using only one lane in each tunnel is interesting because it eliminates the risk of frontal collision and does not increase the transit capacity .  the model that was unthinkable ten years ago is being tested successfully between morges and lausanne .  the emergency lanes have been refurbished and are activated for regular driving at peak hours to avoid the usual traffic jam .  not a perfect solution but the results are ,  nevertheless ,  encouraging: fewer accidents and less pollution . 
__label__0 pete: the idea is not stupid .  the existing tunnel will have to be closed completely for repairs .  the drive over the saint gotthard pass road is beautiful and becomes a nightmare when a few underpowered trailers are in front of you .  the use of the four lanes  ( old and new )  would require a change of our constitution that is ,  at least at present ,  quite likely to be rejected by the voters .  those travelers who do not enjoy the three hour waiting time may be encouraged to take the train when new basis tunnel opens .

__label__0 you have all missed the obvious- no matter how "well made" ,  the counterfeiters can only copy the originals- they have no ability to create- no ability to lead the market; only to follow .  this should be taken as a call for swiss made products to lead the market with authority and to be highly competitive in doing so . 
__label__0 sorry to say so ,  pieter: you are missing the most obvious .  when a counterfeit product is of excellent quality and sold as authentic ,  that is outright cheating .  many companies spend a lot of money to track down these illegal factories and the buyer of the "real thing" ultimately pays for it .  you cannot compare this to the copies of old master paintings made by talented artists providing they are clearly identified as copies .  some even carry a certificate to that effect .

__label__0 an immigrant is never the same as a refugee or an asylum seeker .  immigrants can best be defined as " making a contribution to society " ,  whereas the other two are best described as opportunists . 
__label__0 well ,  you need to be careful when discussing immigration to australia .  i was there last week ,  and staying with some friends who are native aboriginals .  the news is full of discussion concerning the "boat people" ,  which is what white australians call asian immigrants who arrive on boats .  to the aboriginals ,  this is extremely funny .  to them ,  all white australians are "boat people" ,  and all they see is one lot of boat people accussing another lot of boat people of being boat people .  there is a deep irony in all the populist debate about immigration ,  and that is simply that the entire concept of national identity and borders to restrict human movement are very recent inventions .  arguably ,  humans have always been free to move across the face of the earth ,  and the legal fashion to prevent this freedom is an abuse of the most undamental human right of all .  i mean ,  consider what it means for one human being to tell another human being what part of god ' s earth they can and cannot travel .  by what power are these dictates authorized ?  membership of a party ?  accident of birth ?  in fact ,  it is always membership of some party .  we should not forget that in every genocide ,  accident of birth is no license to remain living in the land of your ancestors .  ask the jews ,  or the australian aboriginals ,  if you doubt this .  therefore the swiss who love to wave the flag and preach their inherent rights should beware of the tiger whose tail they are grabbing .  in the blink of a politcal eye ,  the wrong type of swiss could be exterminated and banned from their ancestral lands simply because they fail to meet the arbitrary criteria of some popular cult .  immigration policy must always be informed by human rights law ,  and never the rerverse . 
__label__0 why nurse betty ,  i am exactly calling for education on this ,  and all sexual orientations .  are you advocating discrimination against some sexual orientations out of your fears and phobias ? 
__label__0 i am not from china .  however i have great experience with chinese people and chinese goods .  if and when an fta is signed with china ,  only a handful of swiss people ,  namely businessmen and business-owners will benefit .  the rest of the swiss people will not benefit .  instead swiss market will be flooded  ( believe it or not )  with less-than-safe food products from china ,  less-than-tested toys and it is "the end" for swiss quality when they will blatantly copy everything from rolex to appenzeller cheese .  don ' t believe me ?  just copy my text and read it again in 5 years . 
__label__0 you state :the land of israel belongs to the jews ,  because they were there first .  by the same logic ,  the land of north and south america belongs to the indigenous peoples  ,  also because they were there first ,  right  ?  i am looking forward to seeing an answer from you . 
__label__0 posting about fur coats and nuclear power is one thing .  incitement to hatred and violence is another .  these posters were put up with the intention to incite hatred and nothing else .   ' resistance '  in this context means violence ,  like suicide bombing and the murder of israeli civilians ,  including women and children .  the swiss federal court has made a very serious mistake . 
__label__1 a tactic regularly used by the backers of violence against the palestinian people ,  they know they are commiting genocide against the palestinians and can not debate it so they have to hide and silence any dissent ,  in any form ,  including these placards .  let the truth be told in all areas . 
__label__0 i feel like i am in an orwell novel listening to swiss commenters here .  a whistleblower gave information of german citizens conspiring with swiss bankers to break german laws to evade german taxes .  giving evidence to the german government of german citizens committing crime is not stealing data .  it is reporting evidence of crimes being committed by german citizens .  it is protected by german law .  swiss commenters ,  wake up ,  you can no longer help non swiss citizens evade their taxes .  the world is tired of your pathetic behavior . 
__label__0 @ sven .  .  . exactly !  then they cry racism .  switzerland has to have a backbone or these people will tear up the country and switzerland will lose its status . 
__label__1 they now start to place those people in "abri pc"  ( protection civil )  which are located in public schools !  !  !  asylum seeking men ,  whose origins we don ' t know ,  whose past can be very well criminal and violent ,  who come from completely different culture with different value of human life ,  who may abuse drugs etc are placed near our children !  !  !  and then everybody hopes than nothing bad will ever happen !  this is profanity and irresponsibility to me . 
__label__0 1 .  according to data received from the city of geneva ,  the plan put forward by the sbb would involve the destruction of 380 homes ,  not 150 .  2 .  with regards to the comparison of costs for the surface and underground options ,  both canton and city of geneva have stated that they do not believe the sbb figures ,  which do not correspond to standard sbb project costs ,  and have commissioned their own independent study .  3 .  the mayor of geneva has stated that the city of geneva could be in a position to fund a difference in costs if there is one . 
__label__0 no !  switzerland should remain swiss !  i have 2 years to go before i can apply and i still say this .  let us properly assimilate before giving us the vote .  also let them prove that they are staying here for the long term .  they cannot then vote for something that will be disasterous after they leave . 
__label__0 you took the words out of my mouth . 
__label__0 the only thing less intelligent than joining the eu would be to give foreigners the vote .  you guys dodged the bullet by not formally joining the eu .  switzerland is a very small country whose customs are unique to switzerland .  it wouldn ' t take that many foreigners to upset the balance and vote in ways that wouldn ' t necessarily be in the interest of swiss citizens who have worked for generations to make switzerland the beautiful country it is today .  i think schengen has already done enough damage .  please quit while you are ahead . 
__label__0 great story .  scaramellini ' s speculation is an interesting one ,  would an expanded “fourth league” graubünden really stayed independent ?  the people of graubünden suffered badly during the thirty year war because it was not a full member of the confederation ,  they would have remembered that . 
__label__0 solar cannot be used for base power .  what happens when the sun does not shine ?  the only green energy sources that can be used for base power is geothermal and nuclear .  how about looking at those even if they are not politically correct ? 
__label__1 the marxists indoctrinated the young to allow the innocence and folly of youth to become a tool for their violent revolutions .  what does this have to do with the comment ?  the language in the comment above is indicative of cultural marxism ,  the systematic attack and breakdown of western society and christianity as its basis .  we can see it here: "maybe the students should weigh in on what they value most  ( and least )  . " what values ?  they ' re children .  what "values" could a child possibly have ?  to the cultural marxist they need to foster disrespect between parents and children and it begins in the classroom .  they need to convince the children "you know better than your parents .  your parents are oppressing you .  you can judge for yourself what is valuable to you .  you don ' t need your parent ' s permission . " willi munzenberg  ( frankfurt school )  proposed the solution was to "organize the intellectuals and use them to make western civilization stink .  only then ,  after they have corrupted all its values and made life impossible ,  can we impose the dictatorship of the proletariat . "  ( emphasis mine )  "fostering intellectual development [is] the aim . " in the weimar republic porn was pushed on the youth under the guise of "sexual education . " the frankfurt school of cultural marxism pushed the theories of georg lukacs ,  which he called  ' revolution and eros '  ,  to use foster sexual instincts as a means to break children from their parents .  antonio gramsci felt that christianity was the greatest threat to marxism because people kept what they created while sharing and charity were individual acts .  a naked assault on christianity ,  culture ,  and tradition would take place in the open by claiming an intellectual high-ground under the pretext of "open-mindedness" ,  "tolerance" ,  and "diversity . " denigrating ,  undermining ,  and smearing european culture ,  heritage ,  and tradition would be the norm while praising anything and everything that was not european or christian  ( and eventually race and gender were included when the first two were not enough )  .  sexual restraint is attacked as "old fashioned" and "passé" .  parents are not allowed to tell their children what is bad because that would be "close-minded" ,  "uneducated" and "anti-intellectual . " children should be taught about cultural marxism so when they become parents they’ll be equipped to identify the diction and methods used to turn their children against them ,  their society ,  their culture ,  their heritage ,  and their people . 
__label__0 good luck svp  .  .  all you can come up with is "negatives"  .  i can ' t see plan how to help with health-care , schools , public , roads  .  .  nor anything more constructive than "let ' s kick foreigners - they are all bad and swiss are the best - as long as not mixed with non-swiss  . " two laws  .  .  like orwel story - just this one becomes realities . 
__label__0 i am in love with switzerland .  hopefully i can live here for the rest of my life !  of course ,  there are also things which i dont like so much about this country  ( this is normal for me )  .  but in the same time ,  i really appreciate switzerland a lot and even the swiss people ,  if you have a bit social skills and you know how to approach them ,  they are really cool and kind friends ! 
__label__0 i spent a year living in naters  /  brig in wallis as an exchange student and it was simply one of the best years of my life .  i found the wallisers to be very welcoming people who couldn ' t do enough to share their culture with me .  i found they opened a door to the "real" switzerland which the tourists rarely see .  unfortunately broad perceptions of any country by those outside it are usually based on superficial and populist knowledge . 
__label__0 i would have thought that all this publicity was great advertising for swiss banks .  after all ,  if mitt romney banks here ,  it must be pretty good quality !  until all governments are honest ,  impartial and fair ,  and form one world government to rule everybody under one set of laws ,  then switzerland is still in business as a center of world banking .  frankly ,  if the american government or any american people really believe that they are the greatest country on earth ,  and the proper judges of what is good and reasonable conduct ,  then they have become utterly deluded by their own self serving propaganda ,  and will make far more enemies than friends in the world . 
__label__0 mr .  romney is trying to convey the idea of a person who knows how to create jobs for american workers .  at a time when millions of u . s .  workers are unemployed ,  and u . s .  corporations are sitting on a record amount of cash  ( $1 . 7 trillion dollars )  ,  parking money outside the u . s .  and not putting it to work in the u . s .  economy is not the best strategy for someone running for president  ( since 2008 )   .  .  .  this has less to do with switzerland ,  than with how mitt romney is presenting himself to the american people . 
__label__0 it is a shame devious politicians have created the problem that affects ordinary swiss people living in the usa having to close their swissbank acoounts ,  while they are not willing to be transparent themselves .  shame on them ! 
__label__0 the hypocrisy of the usa knows no limits .  the us govt turned a blind eye for years to the illicit transfer of cash from south america into the american banking system ,  allows delaware to effectively operate like an offshore tax haven ,  for decades has failed to control the enormous mafia money laundering operations on its own soil ,  yet targets foreign banks without respect for the sovereignty of other countries .

__label__0 well - i think we actually can invest massively into infrastructure .  there ' s a just so much potential to tap into ,  in both switzerland and the eu .  and the more ingeniously -in terms of machines and designs- we get our infrastructure expanded ,  the more know-how we will acquire in the process .  know-how that can be sold ,  as it is needed in so many places ,  or will be needed soon .  it will still be a certain burden ,  but why not ?  infrastructure was more expensive for our ancestors ,  and they also built it anyways .  .  . 
__label__0 lynx ,  that is the most unresonable and unconsiderate comment i have ever heard and your intent of destroying the nation from within will not succeed .  you are forgetting that switzerland is the home of the people of switzerland ,  it is our home and when we see these types of attitudes from foreigners it really makes us reflect as a nation ,  be assured that you are very lucky and priviledged to be allowed to live in switzerland however my suggestion to you is that you should not be hard on yourself ,  respect switzerland just as as eevry other true swiss does and if you can ' t do that you are living in the wrong country . 
__label__0 guigi: good point - the motto once used to be: live and let live or let die ,  as be the case .  what is really surprising is that our politicians replace one problem with another .  everything aims at making the population healthier and live longer .  one day they shall have to find a solution to prevent the population becoming too old .  what aldous huxley described in his utopian novel  ( brave new world ,  1940 ' s )  might become reality some day . 
__label__0 "piller dismisses allegations that the proposal by the league is excessive .  “we simply want a uniform solution . ” " really ?  then why did they support stricter regulations in the cantons that have passed them ?  why didn ' t they support the "uniform solution" of allowing businesses to make their own choice as had worked for hundreds of years ?  or do they only say this when it ' s "convenient" for them -- in other words ,  lying .  we ' re seeing the same game played in reverse right now by the antismokers here in pennsylvania: they got a statewide ban but it ' s not as strong as they wanted .  so now they suddenly started yelling that bans should be a local decision and not regulated by the state  ( unless of course some local government wanted a weaker ban .  .  .  then of course they switch arguments again !  )  it ' s important to never forget: antismokers lie to get whatever it is they want at the moment .  read "the lies behind the smoking bans" at tinyurl . com / smokingbanlies and you ' ll see what i mean .  michael j .  mcfadden author of "dissecting antismokers '  brains"

__label__0 the nzz comment on the swiss franc is inaccurate .  even with the 1 . 20 ceiling our currency is presently 36% overvalued .  source: oecd - purchasing power parity comparison ,  published by bloomberg a few days ago .  massive write-offs can indeed occur .  however ,  they cause deflation not inflation ,  as demonstrated during the aftermath of the collapse of the housing bubble in the usa .  what we currently see is a debt and also a confidence crisis .  central banks can do only so much if they lack sufficient political support .  we shall see whether the european politicians have understood mr .  draghi ' s warning message .

__label__0 why do swiss people not understand ?  if you help someone break a law ,  you are just as guilty as the are .  the us only wants people that helped us citizens break the law .  i mean my god ,  a us company improperly used appenzeller on their cheese and the swiss government had a heart attach .  so hypocritical . 
__label__0 absolutely agree ,  but that is not what is being discussed here .  certainly ,  america is at liberty to enact any law they want ,  but that will only apply to the territory of the us .  what this is is acting extraterritorially .  they are seeking to impose their law on other countries .  what is a crime in america is not a crime in switzerland and therefore the accounts held in switzerland by americans should not have been disclosed .

__label__0 a man who singlehandedly changed the course of my future deserves recoginition .  hesse was not only an author ,  but an inspiration .  living in a world of west versus west ,  he was able to manage a secure foothold in teachings of the east .  he was able to transcribe them to his fellow western minds; and able to teach genenrations to come what can truly be felt with thought and spirit .  when one looks back upon  ' winners '  in literary merit ,  his gaze should transfix on hesse ,  and realize that spirituality if only part of the picture . 
__label__0 how truly spoken orca ! 
__label__0 maybe my born-swiss "friends" on here can explain how forced marriages or divorces are affecting swiss society and culture .  it is not clear from the article who is responsible for this situation .  is it the swiss or the foreigners ?  in some cultures ,  arranged marriages are the norm .  foreigners living here are often unable to leave their own culture behind and it takes a while to adjust to the swiss way .  it is like putting a fish on land and saying "breathe" . 
__label__0 lynx: switzerland and their citizens have no need or any desire to adopt to such disgusting and despicable foreign culture or norm . 
__label__0 what ?  ?  more careless data processing practices in evidence at ubs ?  ha !  no one should be at all surprised since all of the inept middle management is still employed there ,  each cowering ,  frozen in fear and doing nothing but trying to protect themselves and preserve their jobs .  wise customers took their accounts from this failing  ( and still flailing )  institution years ago .  hopefully someone will soon come along and put  ( switzerland and )  this bank out of misery .  otherwise the embarassment and blight upon swiss banking that ubs clearly is will obviously simply continue .

__label__0 what ever happened to the famed swiss neutrality  ?  ?  ?  why is switzerland taking sides in this fight  ?

__label__1 agree ,  john lennon ' s lyrics are rubbish and irresponsible .  what the world need is god ' s words - the bible !  whatever happened to switzerland the country where john calvin continued the reformation ?  !  i hope all swiss would be proud of their heritage that their ancestors embraced the protestant faith and placed god ' s words so highly in their life .  geneva was a refuge for those who faced religious persecution for the truth and so it please god to bless switzerland to what it is today ,  one of the best country in the world with peace and prosperity .

__label__0 switzerland has been accepting deposits from foreign political persons and wealthy persons for many years .  what about the nazi heirchary of germans during world war ii keeping their deposits in swiss banks  ?  all of this has been perfectly legal so why is anyone offended  ? 
__label__0 oh swiss my dear dear swiss why do you even respond to this silliness .  .  .  .  . we didn ' t even know this video existed until you complained about it so in reality you are making this popular by even talking about it .  .  .  . fact remains that we like rich ,  we want to be rich so nobody really sees this video as a negative
__label__1 disturbing ?  really ?  you think that attacking people with rhetoric rather than facts is disturbing ?  get some more education ,  please .  and who is spoiled and so important ?  seems its always the  ( mostly swiss )  men who post here that have a superiority complex .  .  .  i ' ve seen how you treat your women / girls and it isn ' t exactly with equality in mind  ( whether they stay at home or not )  .  it ' s more with getting what you want in mind . 
__label__1 dj ,  i think you are generalizing too much .  i take offense at your comment that foreigners aren ' t making ch better .  foreigners are limited to making ch better in the economic sphere only .  the swiss have no problem using foreign labor or ideas to improve their companies and economy .  but ,  the swiss reject input on all other matters  ( such as education ,  social life ,  etc )  .  i can imagine that lots of educated foreigners give up and settle for making money and getting on with their lives .  who can blame them ? 
__label__1 my ex-swiss wife wanted to leave perfect little switzerland after we were married and live in my country .  i stayed here because i like it so much ,  but ,  as i keep saying ,  it isn ' t perfect .  nowhere is .  the grass isn ' t greener on the other side .  having been married to a swiss ,  i now know i definitely was not "fortunate" ,  nor are most foreigners i know ,  and many swiss .  hence the high divorce rate .  dj .  what about you ? 
__label__1 sorry ,  couldn ' t resist .  if the family model you are talking about is so successful why do 50% of those marriages end in divorce ?  obviously something is amiss and girls especially should be prepared for the worst rather than the rosey picture of "family" life that you present .  too many girls are encouraged to prepare for the fantasy family life and not encouraged to invest in their educations .  so ,  i suspect many of these girls  ( 50% if statistics on divorce are correct )  will wind up having to choose between staying in a bad marriage for the sake of money or leaving and being saddled with kids and a lower household income since the men get all the best jobs .  this sounds like a great life .  .  .  sign me up . 
__label__1 at least the woman who is the subject of the article had a choice --much like i do .  but ,  what you are proposing is for women not to have choices .  let me give you a little tip .  if you want swiss women to have more babies and grow your wonderful families ,  why don ' t you let them have more flexibility and choices for how to do that ?  guess what ?  if you do ,  they will have even more babies for you and might even love you more . 
__label__1 dj probably thinks women should have 4 buttons on their heads .  cooking ,  cleaning ,  sex and an off switch .  a woman ' s place is in the home ,  eh dj ?  sorry ,  but this is not the case any more .  women should have exactly the same rights ,  salary and conditions at work as men .  perhaps it ' s time for dj to leave and move to ,  say ,  iraq . 
__label__1 prior to getting married ,  decide if the union includes children .  one partner stays home til the kids are about 16 years old .  old fashioned yes ,  but good for the kids .  less material goods but a real family life .  it can be done  ! 
__label__1 krippe and child care eats up a lot of earning from the part time mother ,  which demotivate the women’s to work .  we donate and charity out side switzerland to help poor countries ,  but swiss government do not want to help its own society ,  at the moment the krippe / day care are subsidized for the least earning group of families ,  why not increase the coverage to include middle class families ?  women’s get double cut on her financial sheet ,  huge charges by krippe and less saleries  ( due to part time work )   ,  more over there is a well known difference of salaries between man and women’s . 
__label__1 so ,  mary ,  why don ' t you say something meaningful ?  not quite educated enough ? 
__label__1 lunches at school ?  no thanks !  one parent belongs at home with the children ,  if both want to work then don ' t bother with kids .  or move to america where both parents work so they can buy more crap for their kids as the norm .  parenting is my job ,  and a valued job at that .  instead of trying to feel good about yourself by having a  ' career '  try seeing value in a good home for your child with healthy food ,  values ,  no tv ,  etc .  i ' m a stay at home dad ,  i value quality ,  gender equality ,  and my children . 
__label__0 the system is designed still to force one parent to be at home ,  and the preference in the way it is shaped here is that it should be the woman .  it is an archaic structure . 
__label__0 dj ,  do you have difficulty reading ?  ari said she doesn ' t feel respected as an equal .  so much for the theory that women can do whatever they want without being made to feel like a failure .  i can tell you for a fact that isn ' t always true .  besides ,  i ' m kinda tired of hearing from men on this subject .  why don ' t more swiss women speak out ?  are they afraid ? 
__label__0 almost all mothers i know stay ( ed )  at home to look after their children ,  those who don ' t  ( full time )  were generally either foreigners  ( who think it ' s normal for both parents to work )  or single parents .  working when you have children is defintely looked down upon ,  like you are letting your kids down or something .  .   ( more interested in money ,  holidays etc )  .  it ' s actually quite difficult to work as a mother given that every school class can have different starting times ,  lunch times and finishing times only leaving a clear "core time" of just over 1 hour in the morning and one hour in the afternoon  ( as was in our case )  .  even different holidays for different age kids in the same school !  it ' s quite a common story for mothers to come home from work / shopping / meeting friends to find a child sitting on the door step as they were sent home either due to illness or absent teachers .  .  in the village i used to live in there were arguments  (  "it ' s bad for the children" etc .  )  over the community ' s suggestion to organise a "mittagstisch" for kids whose parents were at work and couldn ' t get home at lunchtime and inevitably  ( when it evenutally happened ,  some 5 years after first being mooted )  it ended up being all the foreign kids .  .  having said all this ,  it was obviously great for my kids having their mum around but in my opinion this should be the choice of the parents and not somebody else .  it ' s very difficult to return to work after such a long break to look after 2  ( or more )  kids and most don ' t manage it successfully .

__label__0 what do you mean by we ?  you are not swiss .  .  . 
__label__0 ah ,  but i am .  in the eyes of my community ,  my kanton and my government ,  i am swiss .  they wouldn ' t have given me a lovely red passport with a white cross on it  ( and 5 languages ,  the fifth being english ,  lol )  ,  otherwise .  i followed the rules ,  integrated as far as the born-swiss would let me ,  paid everything on time ,  have never been unemployed or committed a crime  ( except for having an opinion )  but ,  instead of saying "welcome to our club" ,  the born-swiss say i ' m not a real swiss" .  also ,  i pay an extortionate amount in tax ,  paying extra for those who are avoiding tax ,  especially the rich .  so dj ,  like it or not ,  we are both swiss ,  lol . 
__label__1 lucky for you my last post was not printed .  .  . it takes a lot to run a country and keep the standards high ,  even chocolate !  foreigners are working to make money ,  not to make switzerland better .  .  . lol
__label__1 me thinks dj is a blocher supporter .  the only people coming from abroad to get help with healthcare are the super wealthy arabs and russians who are the consumers of switzerland ' s medical tourism industry .  not quite the same as people coming from all over to "get help . "
__label__1 dj ,  it ' s nice to only reference the "lackluster" talents of those migrating to ch from less developed countries but that really doesn ' t paint the whole picture .  highly paid management and scientific jobs are being taken over by foreigners because the swiss aren ' t educated enough to take them up .  would you like a two-tiered society where most of the rich are foreigners and the swiss can only aspire to being middle class ?  as for how well the swiss manage chalets in st moritz ,  etc-- i have actually stayed at badrutt ' s palace and at many 5-star hotels around the world .  there isn ' t anything extraordinarily "special" about how the swiss manage badrutt ' s compared to other 5star hotels like mandarin oriental ,  four seasons or certain boutique hotels around the world .  i know you ' ve been brainwashed to believe that quality is only a swiss thing but that isn ' t true .  i ' ve had better service in many other places . 
__label__1 i don ' t think people are criticizing the whole of swiss society just because they want equal rights for women .  sure ,  there are some positive things about living here but as an educated woman ,  there are far more negatives .  why must there be a one size fits all model with only two choices for women ?  every woman must get married ,  have children and be financially dependent on a man or stay single and have a career ?  ?  ?  ?  this isn ' t much of a choice .  why can ' t other family models be considered equally supported in society so that all children can really be put first . 
__label__1 lol .  .  . how many choices are there ?  you can do what you want .  if you want to become a single parent you can do that too .  marriage is no guarantee that you will be married for the rest of your life .  and being "educated" is about much ,  much ,  more than a college degree .  your taking education to mean "snobbish and arrogant . " there is no need for that in switzerland .  that is one of the beauties of switzerland you can take off the mask and be a "real human being . " family makes the society and if you do not care about the family then you can look at us and uk for an example .  .  . you can always go live in one of those places and be a single mom with your transgender husband ,  with one biological child ,  and two adopted kids ,  about to lose your home ,  with a gun hiding under your bed ! is that the variety you are looking for ?  i mean there are all types of scenarios .  .  . switzerland just happens to be a country run by "intelligent people" who understand the "basics of life . " forget all the other hoopla .  . go to the us if you want to live the delusion of "having it all" which does not exist .  .  . 
__label__1 i once saw some statistics about swiss divorce .  how do they get to 50% ?  swiss-swiss has a 33% chance of divorce .  swiss guy ,  foreign girl housewife has a 34% chance .  so where does the rest come from ?  swiss girl ,  foreign guy slave has over 80% chance of ending in divorce .  i don ' t know anywhere else in the world that has such a high local-foreign marriage combination .  i wonder what is wrong with the swiss that they cannot even marry themselves .  but marrying foreigners obviously isn ' t the solution either .  perhaps they should stay single . 
__label__1 dj-- do you always speak without knowing any facts ?  first it ' s none of your business why i ' m in ch and i don ' t owe you any explanation .  second ,  how many other places have you actually lived ?  i like the flag waving and all but it gets a bit boring .  i ' ve lived in many places and managed to find something worth improving in all of them !  it ' s called being objective . 
__label__1 @lynx .  .  . lol .  . and you accused me of sounding like the taliban !  so families should be restricted to two children and what else ,  women should have selective abortions as well ?  .  .  . even though i do agree that people should plan financially before having children; however ,  life is tricky and things happen ,  you never know when you will need help . 
__label__1 maybe you can find the unine study that proves that educated women in ch who live in urban areas like zh and ge with robust childcare alternatives are combining careers  ( not just jobs which is different )  with having children .  in fact ,  the birth rate in these urban areas currently exceeds that in the rural areas of ch .  why do you think that is ?  maybe it is because women are allowed more choices ?  yes ,  in the 70s / 80s birth rates overall fell as women took up opportunities previously not available to them .  but ,  some countries  ( france ,  usa ,  and in deed ,  some areas of ch )  have seen a rise in birth rates during the 90s / 00s due to the availability of more options for childcare !  it seems giving women the ability to choose increases their willingness to have more children . 
__label__0 don ' t give him one franc
__label__1 disturbing ?  really ?  you think that attacking people with rhetoric rather than facts is disturbing ?  get some more education ,  please .  and who is spoiled and so important ?  seems its always the  ( mostly swiss )  men who post here that have a superiority complex .  .  .  i ' ve seen how you treat your women / girls and it isn ' t exactly with equality in mind  ( whether they stay at home or not )  .  it ' s more with getting what you want in mind . 
__label__1 lucky for you my last post was not printed .  .  . it takes a lot to run a country and keep the standards high ,  even chocolate !  foreigners are working to make money ,  not to make switzerland better .  .  . lol
__label__1 you can try and save up ,  then move  ( assuming you have no husband which can provide for you and the kids ,  assuming you have any )  .  try countries on one extreme that try to separate woman from nature  ( sweden or norway ) ; or possibly the other extreme  ( afghanistan )  . 
__label__1 @lynx .  .  . lol .  . and you accused me of sounding like the taliban !  so families should be restricted to two children and what else ,  women should have selective abortions as well ?  .  .  . even though i do agree that people should plan financially before having children; however ,  life is tricky and things happen ,  you never know when you will need help . 
__label__1 dj - what do the womenfolk in your family think ?  that is the issue .  or are you a single guy with no experience of anything ,  attacking anyone who dares to oppose your factless comments ?  i believe women should have equal rights as men and that if you cannot afford many children ,  you should not expect the government to support you .  simply don ' t have them .  one day the world will be in trouble - too few resources ,  too many people ,  eventually more wars . 
__label__1 still looking forward to some intellectual input from swiss women .  maybe you can ' t count ,  but it seems that dj wins the prize for number of irrelevant posts with little fact and since he isn ' t a woman i find it a bit revealing of his lack of respect for women .  but ,  i will take you at your word .  .  .  you are a happy swiss woman ,  right ?  now ,  tell me why others need to be just like you or something is wrong with them ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  to use the only word dj seems capable of spelling: lol ,  lol ,  lol !

__label__1 my apologies ,  it seems you have completely missed my point: (  i have no delusions of being morally superior by being a stay at home dad ,  just saying it would be nice if society placed value in it .  and as far as getting out of their way for school ?  i hope you ' re referring to university .  i feel the elementary school years and teen years are when children need you to be there for them the most .  the swiss culture tends to support this notion .  if you prefer to put your kid in daycare at age 6 years  ( weeks for some people )  ,  you ' re not morally inferior ,  but we surely have a difference of opinion .  as for american worker bees .  . oh please !  i dislike generalizations but that ' s not an accurate stereotype .  chinese ,  swiss ,  bergamascos ,  koreans .  .  . maybe ,  but sure as heck not americans .   ( i ' m american and grew up in the u . s ,  moved to switzerland 4 years ago )  i find your american worker bee analogy completely ridiculous .  my american wife has witnessed the difference from the u . s .  to ch first hand ,  and i doubt she would describe americans as worker bees .  creative ,  approachable ,  informal ,  fun perhaps .  then again it is a big country ,  perhaps you happen to live in a hive i haven ' t seen .  but in the end ,  regardless of where you live i value and appreciate a good worker ,  whether it ' s in the office ,  at the sawmill ,  or in kitchen . 
__label__1 switzerland ' s society is working .  sweden ' s is not .  not all progress is beneficial .  men still want a housewife because it is biologically evolved that way over thousands of years .  i rather have something packed at home .  you intention to change will not have that great of effect and you should want to have facilities do it for different reason rather then trying to change the social fabric of a society . 
__label__1 the system is designed still to force one parent to be at home ,  and the preference in the way it is shaped here is that it should be the woman .  it is an archaic structure . 
__label__1 switzerland is not the taliban .  .  . lol "genuine swiss" women have an opportunity to raise their children without the foolishness of the illusion of "having it all" which does not exist .  .  . they can work or not work ,  it is up to them at least they know that the swiss government backs them and their family will be taken care of .  no family in switzerland has to be on the street .  many other countries do not have that and they have failing societies as well .  .  . 
__label__1 dj ,  you have thus far been unable to stick to the subject .  i think you have trouble reading .  i have said time and time again that if women want to stay home let them .  that is not the issue .  the issue is that some women want more than that and deserve to be able to choose how to balance those aspects of their lives without having men like you dictate what their range of choices should be .  have you left your career to stay home with your kids ?  probably not-- so what you have to say about it is of limited value .  you would rather oppress people with your silly one-size fits all policies than to allow women the real freedom to do as they choose .  obviously you think very little of women ' s intelligence to choose for themselves . 
__label__1 many working swiss women marry a man simply so that he can stay at home and look after the house and children ,  taking the role of women .  this is what my ex expected from me .  she is twice divorced now ,  still looking for her slave .  what do you think about men staying at home dj ?  what does your wife think ? 
__label__1 dj ,  i think you are generalizing too much .  i take offense at your comment that foreigners aren ' t making ch better .  foreigners are limited to making ch better in the economic sphere only .  the swiss have no problem using foreign labor or ideas to improve their companies and economy .  but ,  the swiss reject input on all other matters  ( such as education ,  social life ,  etc )  .  i can imagine that lots of educated foreigners give up and settle for making money and getting on with their lives .  who can blame them ? 
__label__1 @ef .  .  . why are you staying in a country that you feel does not benefit you ?  how does your swiss spouse feel about your continuous complaining about his country ?  switzerland has "3" cities in the top 10 best cities in the world to live ,  are any of those cities ,  you say you ' ve lived in; however ,  i have my doubts that you have ,  on that list ?  of course ,  there are other countries that have adequate standards of living but switzerland happens to be one of the top ?  are you trying to deny that ?  as far as foreigners and work are concerned ,  switzerland is beginning to change that .  .  . finally .  the swiss mistake was accepting the schengen agreement ,  but that is about to change ,  they have already put some restrictions on people from certain countries recently .  foreigners come to switzerland because "there is work . " you can always run over to spain ,  portugal ,  or greece .  .  . do they have work ?  everyone wants to flock to switzerland because it is so well managed and there is plenty of work ,  in most respects .  switzerland is a country with high standards and many just aren ' t used to that i do not care how "well traveled a person claims to be . "
__label__1 i don ' t think people are criticizing the whole of swiss society just because they want equal rights for women .  sure ,  there are some positive things about living here but as an educated woman ,  there are far more negatives .  why must there be a one size fits all model with only two choices for women ?  every woman must get married ,  have children and be financially dependent on a man or stay single and have a career ?  ?  ?  ?  this isn ' t much of a choice .  why can ' t other family models be considered equally supported in society so that all children can really be put first .

__label__1 i love having conversations with the fanatics .  it stops me getting bored .  still ,  some of the comments on here and elsewhere in swiss media make it very clear why the status quo will never change .  if i had a franc for every "if you don ' t like it ,  leave" comment ,  i ' d be a millionaire by now . 
__label__1 i ' ve just looked back at the 73 comments  ( so far )  on this article and cannot find any reference to me accusing you of being like the taliban .  my 2 children comment is addressing over-population which ,  one day ,  will be a world problem .  but ,  this is nothing to do with this news item ,  so lets get back to the main issue ,  which you are avoiding .  what does your wife or mother think about swiss mothers holding back from having it all  ? 
__label__1 @lynx ,  you cannot slide your way so easily out of this one .  now that your "real colors" are showing you want to "get back to the main issue . " .  .  . lol your comment was nothing short of a totalitarian ,  dictatorship .  and this is why switzerland does not need the input of people who have no idea about running a society .  your true views are degrading to women and if you had it your way women in switzerland would be even more repressed than you say they are !  and another thing .  .  . swiss mothers are not "holding back from having it all" .  .  . having it all does not exist and they are intelligent enough to understand that .  children need their parents and there is nothing wrong with sacrificing a few material things for that purpose .  this "having it all" concept is nothing but american propaganda and look at american society today .  the women that started this "having it all in usa" decided to call it a wrap and nurture their husbands !  .  .  . lol
__label__1 dj ,  i will stand up for swiss women even if they don ' t stand up for me because i have a daughter whose future i care deeply about .  that said ,  i ' m no expert on the swiss economy but i have a theory .  the swiss "immigration problem" will not be solved simply by letting fewer people into the country .  it will only be solved when the low birth rate / aging population problem is tackled and the education system is upgraded to prepare more people  ( boys and girls )  for brainy jobs .  seems to me swiss women could help out a lot here  ( those that choose to anyway )  .  by having better work / family balance support ,  swiss women / girls could greatly ease the burden of the need for immigration .  swiss women are smart and their talents are underutilized ! 
__label__1 switzerland works just fine .  the kids are brought up properly ,  they are well educated and the pay levels allow for one partner to stay at home and make this happen .  if you don ' t like the life style then move out .  .  . pretty simple really .  switzerland is the model for how other countries should work and my family loves it ! 
__label__1 disturbing ?  really ?  you think that attacking people with rhetoric rather than facts is disturbing ?  get some more education ,  please .  and who is spoiled and so important ?  seems its always the  ( mostly swiss )  men who post here that have a superiority complex .  .  .  i ' ve seen how you treat your women / girls and it isn ' t exactly with equality in mind  ( whether they stay at home or not )  .  it ' s more with getting what you want in mind . 
__label__1 you are absolutely correct !  it is those naysayers ,  especially those who have been "fortunate" enough to marry a swiss and get swiss citizenship that sit and complain .  they speak as if they "know what switzerland needs , " what a joke !  the point is that switzerland does not need them !  so lynx and ef can leave at any time !  people always want to come into a place "that is already working" and want to think that they know how to make it "better" when the fact is ,  switzerland works .  no place is perfect ,  and no ,  foreigners are not going to take over switzerland ,  then who would run the country ?  foreigners that come to a country rarely have the intelligence to run the country because they are coming into a situation that is already made .  it is easy to find fault when you ' ve done nothing to help .  so i guess we can take someone from sri lanke ,  india ,  portugal ,  africa etc .  . to tell the swiss how to run their country ?  forget it !  people from countries all over the world come to switzerland for help even if it is to observe their ideas like the usa did concerning health care . besides power is not in numbers it goes to those who are more intelligent .  so to answer your question lynx .  . no foreigners will not take over switzerland .  for example ,  even though i like people from india ,  what do they know about running a ski chalet in st .  moritz ?  the whole industry would die .  what does africa care about chocolates and who would manage swiss chocolate if they took over ?  switzerland would cease to exist .  switzerland has a culture that must be upheld and foreigners would turn switzerland into a cesspool .  .  . and by the way being "stuck" in switzerland is not a bad thing at all .  .  . at least if a woman wants to stay home with her child / ren she is not considered a failure .  foolish american concepts plague the minds of the weak and look at the state of the american society .  it is very easy ,  if you do not like the way switzerland is run you are more than welcome to leave .  . believe me the country will manage very well without you .  .  . lol
__label__1 to dj: can you bring out some historical references how come switzerland become rich in the last 50 years ?  what swiss has worked hard as you seem to be proud of to acheive this richness ?  what is so complicated in making chocolate and running chalets ?  how difficult is managing the cows in grass fields ?  the existence of the swiss economy is depending on eu and usa  ,  is that why you bow down and breach your own bank secrecy law to pass on the information on tax theives in other countries ?  shall i continue to point out some more greatness of your country ?  as other said  ,  i agree its a great place to live ,  and forigner are working here also to make this place better ( not all outsiders are criminals )  you seems talking like you own the swiss and is on a moon trip dj . 
__label__1 lucky for you my last post was not printed .  .  . it takes a lot to run a country and keep the standards high ,  even chocolate !  foreigners are working to make money ,  not to make switzerland better .  .  . lol
__label__1 my ex-swiss wife wanted to leave perfect little switzerland after we were married and live in my country .  i stayed here because i like it so much ,  but ,  as i keep saying ,  it isn ' t perfect .  nowhere is .  the grass isn ' t greener on the other side .  having been married to a swiss ,  i now know i definitely was not "fortunate" ,  nor are most foreigners i know ,  and many swiss .  hence the high divorce rate .  dj .  what about you ? 
__label__0 i don ' t think people are criticizing the whole of swiss society just because they want equal rights for women .  sure ,  there are some positive things about living here but as an educated woman ,  there are far more negatives .  why must there be a one size fits all model with only two choices for women ?  every woman must get married ,  have children and be financially dependent on a man or stay single and have a career ?  ?  ?  ?  this isn ' t much of a choice .  why can ' t other family models be considered equally supported in society so that all children can really be put first . 
__label__1 what are you talking about ?  you sound more brainwashed and fearful than thoughtful and intelligent ?  ?  ?  ?  forget it man .  i can ' t have a conversation with fanatics . 
__label__0 switzerland is about 50 years behind western europe when it comes to women ' s rights .  there is still the feeling that a woman ' s place is at home .  looking at the percentage of swiss men married to women from asian countries ,  one can conclude that is what the swiss men still want - a housewife .  what is needed are pre-school child-care facilities at work and lunches provided at school ,  so children don ' t need to go home at lunchtimes .  until then ,  nothing will change . 
__label__1 dj ,  you are the only one posting that has consistently insulted the intelligence of women with your dictatorial view on what is right or wrong for them .  go back to the stone ages where you belong .  you are probably an old fart like my 80yrs old father-in-law with nothing else to do .  you are struggling for relevance in a world that long ago stopped listening to your rambling ,  irrelevant comments .  women don ' t care what you have to say and thank god for that wonderful act of nature called death-- you will soon be gone and the younger men who try to replicate your thinking will be left out in the cold as women take control of their own lives . 
__label__1 the media has a lot to answer for ,  especially those glossy magazines for women .  there are a lot of articles about women having everything ,  excellent job ,  wonderful kids ,  wonderful husband and friends .  unfortunately ,  in the real world ,  most intelligent women who read the articles and would like to aspire to these great heights ,  just do not have the same support or money as the women highlighted in the magazine articles . 
__label__1 lucky for you my last post was not printed .  .  . it takes a lot to run a country and keep the standards high ,  even chocolate !  foreigners are working to make money ,  not to make switzerland better .  .  . lol
__label__1 dj - why do you put lol at the end of most of your comments ?  ok ,  most of us on here know you are a comedian .  most fanatics are .  but your comments are not funny at all and by putting lol at the end ,  you are indicating to the rest of us that you are not serious about your own views either . 
__label__1 prior to getting married ,  decide if the union includes children .  one partner stays home til the kids are about 16 years old .  old fashioned yes ,  but good for the kids .  less material goods but a real family life .  it can be done  ! 
__label__1 a wise and important ideal .  it is said want the authors of swissinfo chose another commenters post
__label__1 let ' s stick to the issue here .  there is nothing wrong with a woman wanting to stay home with her children .  what is wrong with that ?  the world is not perfect it never will be .  women carry the child and give birth not men .  i think a woman ,  regardless of her work status ,  would like to know that she can stay home with her child if necessary .  what if something went wrong with the birth and the woman needed time at home ?  is she deemed a failure because of it ?  even the leaders of the women ' s lib movement like gloria steinman who preached about women ' s equality and a woman does not need a man got married later in life and you ' ve hardly heard a peep out of her since .  .  . lol her "movement" came to a standstill amidst all of her loyal followers !  she came to one realization "men and women need each other and regardless how anyone wants to try to change nature ,  men and women are different . " deep down inside men and women feel that .  a woman respects a man more if he can take care of the family ,  especially if she is going to bear his children even if she does work .  a man respects a woman who can "do her thing" without trying to compete with him .  that is why western men like asian women .  a mix of femininity with intelligence is enchanting .  a woman who knows that she is a woman and can be a ceo of a company ,  but can leave the chair when she feels like it to take care of her child ,  if need be ,  is to be admired .  swiss society gives women that opportunity and that is one reason why the quality of life in switzerland is so high .  .  . something that you have the opportunity to enjoy . 
__label__1 what should a swiss woman do if she wants more opportunities to balance family life with a career ?  should she leave the country with me and lynx ? 
__label__1 krippe and child care eats up a lot of earning from the part time mother ,  which demotivate the women’s to work .  we donate and charity out side switzerland to help poor countries ,  but swiss government do not want to help its own society ,  at the moment the krippe / day care are subsidized for the least earning group of families ,  why not increase the coverage to include middle class families ?  women’s get double cut on her financial sheet ,  huge charges by krippe and less saleries  ( due to part time work )   ,  more over there is a well known difference of salaries between man and women’s . 
__label__1 this discussion has veered off down all sorts of paths that aren ' t relevant to what women really want .  the article states: "part-time work is the norm in switzerland for mothers in employment .  sixty-one per cent of women with children under 25 choose this arrangement . " the problem with this quote is that you can ' t say that women "choose" this when it is the only work option for them if they have children at home .  of course ,  having it all is a stupid question to pose .  wanting more options for balancing a real career with family life is not "asking to have it all . " and btw to the men who keep hanging their hat on this-- the fact that one woman who is the subject of this article left her career says absolutely nothing about what the majority of women want and deserve .  she was rich enough to do it .  .  . lol .  most women are not . 
__label__1 a wise and important ideal .  it is said want the authors of swissinfo chose another commenters post
__label__1 switzerland is not the taliban .  .  . lol "genuine swiss" women have an opportunity to raise their children without the foolishness of the illusion of "having it all" which does not exist .  .  . they can work or not work ,  it is up to them at least they know that the swiss government backs them and their family will be taken care of .  no family in switzerland has to be on the street .  many other countries do not have that and they have failing societies as well .  .  . 
__label__1 good for you !  at least you had the choice ,  and do not feel "like a failure" because you chose to work part-time and stay with your child .  family is always first .  .  . 
__label__1 why do you want to persist on something that is clear ?  in switzerland women have the luxury of staying home without feeling like a failure .  .  . there is nothing wrong with that .  ari stated "no regrets for working part-time and spending time with her child . " that is why i wrote .  .  . good for her .  .  . at least she could do it and it was a smart thing to do .  do you find something wrong with that ?  men and women are equal but in different ways .  a woman is not a man and a man is not a woman .  lives change once a child is born and anyone thinking they can "continue" on like nothing has happened is foolish .  children need their parents and thank goodness in switzerland it is not seen as something odd .  look at societies with the so-called "having it all attitude" how are they doing ?  .  .  . geez
__label__1 the only one with a limited point of view is dj .  you don ' t know anything about living anywhere else .  heck ,  you haven ' t even lived in the places in ch that you espouse as being so "special" -- those listed as the best cities in the world to live in .  bugger off you old fart .  you are nothing more than a walking advertisement for tourists .  .  .  lol . 
__label__1 my husband and i moved here from the us and were influenced by switzerland ' s good educational system .  my husband is a highly specialized rocket scientist and i have two degrees and my mother tongues are english and spanish .  i was ready to learn german  ( my husband is german )  and to go to the university for my masters or become a teacher but when we began inquiring about kitas ,  we were horrified .  it is the equivalent of sending your child to a ivy league school in the us .  even with my husband ' s income ,  it is more than housing and food combined .  i have seen denmark ' s example on how women are helped by the government to work and study .  even in germany you get some help .  i have only one child so i can only imagine the mother ' s who have three .  they must decide to complete forgo their education and career .  that would put off any women with advanced studies from having children .  it is a shame that those who have so much to offer to society and their children using their knowledge have to decide whether to have no children or have no career .  i lived in the south america for eight years and women are not as far behind rearing children as they are here .  .  . nowhere close to what is happening here .  so many project managers we know have decided not to have children because the family would have to pay so much . 
__label__1 maybe it ' s time we start appreciating staying at home caring for children as a valued job .  switzerland has money for lots of things ,  what about finding a way for paying stay at home parents for their work ?  in other words ,  one parent should be at home and have exactly the same rights ,  salary and conditions at work as the  ' working '  parent .  -- just a crazy idea from a stay at home dad who works hard at a fairly thankless job . 
__label__1 prior to getting married ,  decide if the union includes children .  one partner stays home til the kids are about 16 years old .  old fashioned yes ,  but good for the kids .  less material goods but a real family life .  it can be done  ! 
__label__1 i ' ve just looked back at the 73 comments  ( so far )  on this article and cannot find any reference to me accusing you of being like the taliban .  my 2 children comment is addressing over-population which ,  one day ,  will be a world problem .  but ,  this is nothing to do with this news item ,  so lets get back to the main issue ,  which you are avoiding .  what does your wife or mother think about swiss mothers holding back from having it all  ? 
__label__1 krippe and child care eats up a lot of earning from the part time mother ,  which demotivate the women’s to work .  we donate and charity out side switzerland to help poor countries ,  but swiss government do not want to help its own society ,  at the moment the krippe / day care are subsidized for the least earning group of families ,  why not increase the coverage to include middle class families ?  women’s get double cut on her financial sheet ,  huge charges by krippe and less saleries  ( due to part time work )   ,  more over there is a well known difference of salaries between man and women’s . 
__label__1 do not agree .  i am an asian full time working mother of 2 children .  it is not a question of the society ' s expectation but rather whether a mother is mentally prepared to continue working after child birth and willing to pay the child care but at the end of the day ,  the working mother maintains her self esteem ,  is financially able which results in being a better person ,  hence a better mother ,  wife and woman and quality and standard of life is more satisfying .  my advice to all mothers-to-be is not to give up their job ,  irrespective of position .  it is your job that gives you a self worthiness .  ignore the comments of others and do what you think is right for you as a woman and not what others expect you to do .  plan and organize ,  that is all it takes . 
__label__1 switzerland ' s society is working .  sweden ' s is not .  not all progress is beneficial .  men still want a housewife because it is biologically evolved that way over thousands of years .  i rather have something packed at home .  you intention to change will not have that great of effect and you should want to have facilities do it for different reason rather then trying to change the social fabric of a society . 
__label__0 switzerland is not the taliban .  .  . lol "genuine swiss" women have an opportunity to raise their children without the foolishness of the illusion of "having it all" which does not exist .  .  . they can work or not work ,  it is up to them at least they know that the swiss government backs them and their family will be taken care of .  no family in switzerland has to be on the street .  many other countries do not have that and they have failing societies as well .  .  . 
__label__1 define "genuine" .  all countries in the world were originally populated by people who came from somewhere else .  so ,  really ,  we are a world full of gypsies ,  all trying to see if the grass is greener somewhere else .  most of the time it isn ' t ,  lol . 
__label__1 why do you want to persist on something that is clear ?  in switzerland women have the luxury of staying home without feeling like a failure .  .  . there is nothing wrong with that .  ari stated "no regrets for working part-time and spending time with her child . " that is why i wrote .  .  . good for her .  .  . at least she could do it and it was a smart thing to do .  do you find something wrong with that ?  men and women are equal but in different ways .  a woman is not a man and a man is not a woman .  lives change once a child is born and anyone thinking they can "continue" on like nothing has happened is foolish .  children need their parents and thank goodness in switzerland it is not seen as something odd .  look at societies with the so-called "having it all attitude" how are they doing ?  .  .  . geez
__label__1 dj ' s solution to everything is clear .  if you don ' t like the system as it is then leave ,  lol  !  !  but ,  dj ,  i ask you this .  if all of the foreigners left tomorrow ,  taking everything with them that is not swiss ,  what would the swiss do ?  probably ,  go back to farming ,  yodelling to each other in their isolated valleys ,  living in their chalets .  that was what switzerland was like before the foreigners arrived and improved everything . 
__label__1 fight what ?  switzerland is one of the best countries in the world to live and it is that way because of the society and family structure .  family is important and at least in switzerland a woman does not have to fill like a "failure" because she chooses to stay home with her children .  in switzerland children have rights .  .  . rights to a parent or parents to stay home and "raise" their children instead of putting them off on others to raise .  switzerland has good social benefits hence the reason "venus" may not move away .  at least switzerland helps families in need ,  unlike usa where families are living in the streets .  the woman who wrote this article finally "stepped down from the illusional pedestal . " why ?  because she knows this is a myth about "women having it all ,  not even men have it all . " the two sexes were created for a reason .  women and men are different and there is nothing wrong with that .  should a woman get equal pay for the same job ?  .  .  . yes .  but when a woman decides to have children her life "will change . " whats wrong with the man bringing home the bacon ?  someone wrote the switzerland was 50years behind ,  but look at societies in other countries who are supposedly 50 years ahead .  they are going bankrupt ,  children are neglected join gangs ,  teenage pregnancy is rampant etc .  .  . i guess some people who come to switzerland are so used to deprived societies that when they come to switzerland they have to get used to a society that actually works !  read the other swissinfo story about teenagers and apprenticeship ,  other countries are looking at the swiss model .  "if it ain ' t broke ,  don ' t fix it . " .  .  .  . 
__label__1 the swiss are already a dying breed .  the foreigners will soon outnumber them ,  as the foreigners are the ones making most of the babies .  but will switzerland end up like south africa was ,  with the minority controlling the majority ? 
__label__1 well you should seriously consider it .  if i could get a penny for every person who said men and women are equal i would gladly send you to sweden where you can enjoy the "equality" it has to offer .  the response from dj was far from "fanatic . " the social structure plays a role into the very fabric of society itself .  switzerland is doing quite fine .  the two sexes work in unison rather then fighting to compare each other in the name of "equality" which i find a great thing .  there are so many places destroyed by this as it is .  "the media" i love how you guys think "the media" controls everything .  that doesn ' t just exist in switzerland .  it is not something to be proud of . 
__label__1 at least the woman who is the subject of the article had a choice --much like i do .  but ,  what you are proposing is for women not to have choices .  let me give you a little tip .  if you want swiss women to have more babies and grow your wonderful families ,  why don ' t you let them have more flexibility and choices for how to do that ?  guess what ?  if you do ,  they will have even more babies for you and might even love you more . 
__label__1 the first question isn ' t even worth bothering about .  the second isn ' t even an honest question but a rhetorical one .  first off ,  you should visit sweden .  feminism is the dominant religion in sweden  ( hence your egalitarian utopia )  .  and ,  the last time i checked ,  sweden ' s demographics / population is falling .  they have to import foreigners into the country to mitigate this decline .  if you actually thought about your question instead of asking it in a construed manner to try to win your argument ,  it is pretty obvious .  when women are focused on a career ,  they are less likely to produce children .  the ones who eventually do when they ' re older are more likely to have problems  ( for both her and the child )  .  if such a social structure was instilled ,  women would have less children if non at all because less time would be focused to preparation and willingness to raise them .  if you look cross cultural the more ,  as you put it ,  "archaic , " the larger the families . 
__label__1 @lynx ,  you cannot slide your way so easily out of this one .  now that your "real colors" are showing you want to "get back to the main issue . " .  .  . lol your comment was nothing short of a totalitarian ,  dictatorship .  and this is why switzerland does not need the input of people who have no idea about running a society .  your true views are degrading to women and if you had it your way women in switzerland would be even more repressed than you say they are !  and another thing .  .  . swiss mothers are not "holding back from having it all" .  .  . having it all does not exist and they are intelligent enough to understand that .  children need their parents and there is nothing wrong with sacrificing a few material things for that purpose .  this "having it all" concept is nothing but american propaganda and look at american society today .  the women that started this "having it all in usa" decided to call it a wrap and nurture their husbands !  .  .  . lol

__label__1 maybe you can find the unine study that proves that educated women in ch who live in urban areas like zh and ge with robust childcare alternatives are combining careers  ( not just jobs which is different )  with having children .  in fact ,  the birth rate in these urban areas currently exceeds that in the rural areas of ch .  why do you think that is ?  maybe it is because women are allowed more choices ?  yes ,  in the 70s / 80s birth rates overall fell as women took up opportunities previously not available to them .  but ,  some countries  ( france ,  usa ,  and in deed ,  some areas of ch )  have seen a rise in birth rates during the 90s / 00s due to the availability of more options for childcare !  it seems giving women the ability to choose increases their willingness to have more children . 
__label__1 lunches at school ?  no thanks !  one parent belongs at home with the children ,  if both want to work then don ' t bother with kids .  or move to america where both parents work so they can buy more crap for their kids as the norm .  parenting is my job ,  and a valued job at that .  instead of trying to feel good about yourself by having a  ' career '  try seeing value in a good home for your child with healthy food ,  values ,  no tv ,  etc .  i ' m a stay at home dad ,  i value quality ,  gender equality ,  and my children . 
__label__1 as with every "ism" ,  feminism is ideological .  it therefore presumes a static world ,  a world where social systems can be overloaded with new inputs without undegoing rapid and chaotic phase change away from a complex equlibrium .  communism is the same ,  as is catholicism ,  fascism ,  or any other kind of ideological grand scheme for everyone to follow relentlessly .  feminism presumes that all women are disadvanatged compared to all men .  that presumption is constantly being proved in the media ,  by jounalists who compare men from wealthy families to women from less weatlhy families .  it is the fashionable ideological dogma of our time .  it is the opiate of the modern masses .  "women are oppressed" .  the consequence has been that truly vast sums of money have been borroed by national governments ,  and spent on "women ' s programs" .  markets have been regulated to suit feminisism ,  universities have been censored to suit feminism .  even legal freedoms have been eroded to suit the dogma of feminism ,  where the core article of faith is that all women are oppressed by all men .  curiously ,  and ironically ,  the consequence of this ideological dogma is an explosion of soveriegn debt ,  and world wide financial stagnation and crisis .  we all know very well that western governments have ruined many unborn generations in order to fund their grand schemes and mega projects .  consider the cruel irony of a situation where feminism demands government spending in order to meets its ideological demands ,  but where governments simply do not have the money to pay for such schemes ,  and must borrow in the name of unborn children .  here you see men and women who ,  in the name of that which is feminine ,  destroying the wealfare of yet unborn children in order to prove that they are .  .  .  .  .  what ?  good mothers ?  caring ?  responsible ?  powerful ?  free ?  greedy and aggresive ,  ideological driven and fanatical ?  we live in interesting times . 
__label__1 assuming dj is married ,  i would love to find out what his wife thinks ,  assuming she is allowed to speak that is . 
__label__0 you can try and save up ,  then move  ( assuming you have no husband which can provide for you and the kids ,  assuming you have any )  .  try countries on one extreme that try to separate woman from nature  ( sweden or norway ) ; or possibly the other extreme  ( afghanistan )  .

__label__1 switzerland is about 50 years behind western europe when it comes to women ' s rights .  there is still the feeling that a woman ' s place is at home .  looking at the percentage of swiss men married to women from asian countries ,  one can conclude that is what the swiss men still want - a housewife .  what is needed are pre-school child-care facilities at work and lunches provided at school ,  so children don ' t need to go home at lunchtimes .  until then ,  nothing will change . 
__label__1 the system is designed still to force one parent to be at home ,  and the preference in the way it is shaped here is that it should be the woman .  it is an archaic structure . 
__label__1 let ' s stick to the issue here .  there is nothing wrong with a woman wanting to stay home with her children .  what is wrong with that ?  the world is not perfect it never will be .  women carry the child and give birth not men .  i think a woman ,  regardless of her work status ,  would like to know that she can stay home with her child if necessary .  what if something went wrong with the birth and the woman needed time at home ?  is she deemed a failure because of it ?  even the leaders of the women ' s lib movement like gloria steinman who preached about women ' s equality and a woman does not need a man got married later in life and you ' ve hardly heard a peep out of her since .  .  . lol her "movement" came to a standstill amidst all of her loyal followers !  she came to one realization "men and women need each other and regardless how anyone wants to try to change nature ,  men and women are different . " deep down inside men and women feel that .  a woman respects a man more if he can take care of the family ,  especially if she is going to bear his children even if she does work .  a man respects a woman who can "do her thing" without trying to compete with him .  that is why western men like asian women .  a mix of femininity with intelligence is enchanting .  a woman who knows that she is a woman and can be a ceo of a company ,  but can leave the chair when she feels like it to take care of her child ,  if need be ,  is to be admired .  swiss society gives women that opportunity and that is one reason why the quality of life in switzerland is so high .  .  . something that you have the opportunity to enjoy . 
__label__1 keeping kids in school during lunch hours would do wonders in terms of easing the logistical issues associated with a two parent household . 
__label__1 switzerland works just fine .  the kids are brought up properly ,  they are well educated and the pay levels allow for one partner to stay at home and make this happen .  if you don ' t like the life style then move out .  .  . pretty simple really .  switzerland is the model for how other countries should work and my family loves it ! 
__label__1 me thinks dj is a blocher supporter .  the only people coming from abroad to get help with healthcare are the super wealthy arabs and russians who are the consumers of switzerland ' s medical tourism industry .  not quite the same as people coming from all over to "get help . "
__label__1 dj digresses too much .  the point isn ' t whether ch needs me or lynx .  the point is-- why are swiss women so unhappy with their options for balancing family life and careers  ( and i don ' t mean a part time job at the local migros )  .  if swiss women were a bit more brave they would do more than talk-- they would walk .  oh ,  they are already doing that by not having any swiss babies ,  birthrates are so low the swiss must import labor to fill the gap . 
__label__1 what should a swiss woman do if she wants more opportunities to balance family life with a career ?  should she leave the country with me and lynx ? 
__label__1 i ' m not complaining .  just stating facts .  switzerland is a great place to live ,  but it isn ' t perfect in a lot of respects .  no country is .  as for leaving ,  where would i go ?  i am swiss ,  albeit a forward-thinking one .  i want to make my country better ,  not keep it how it is .  what about you ,  dj ? 
__label__1 at least the woman who is the subject of the article had a choice --much like i do .  but ,  what you are proposing is for women not to have choices .  let me give you a little tip .  if you want swiss women to have more babies and grow your wonderful families ,  why don ' t you let them have more flexibility and choices for how to do that ?  guess what ?  if you do ,  they will have even more babies for you and might even love you more .

__label__1 @lynx .  .  . lol .  . and you accused me of sounding like the taliban !  so families should be restricted to two children and what else ,  women should have selective abortions as well ?  .  .  . even though i do agree that people should plan financially before having children; however ,  life is tricky and things happen ,  you never know when you will need help . 
__label__1 you are late .  .  . the world is already in trouble ,  and who i am or "am not" is no one ' s business .  men and women are equal ,  but in different ways .  .  . society can ' t change nature .  males and females were created equal it is man that has created the illusion of "inequality . "
__label__1 some women return to the workforce after several years in the early childhood of their children .  they earn 30-40% less than men in similar positions ,  and they are then expected to pay in lieu of their stayhome mothering to a childcare or krippe which charges 100-150chf per day per child ,  wiping out most or all of their day-job salaries .  this makes it very inefficient economically for a "talented" woman to return to the workforce ,  unless she is one of the top-flight earners in a top-flight job .  but these are far and few and anyway these type of women at the top ,  they cannot remain housewife nor mothers-at-home .  the rest of the normal women have to stay home and be a mother ,  a housewife and house-cleaner .  there is really no other way around this . 
__label__1 the system is designed still to force one parent to be at home ,  and the preference in the way it is shaped here is that it should be the woman .  it is an archaic structure . 
__label__1 dj ,  you have thus far been unable to stick to the subject .  i think you have trouble reading .  i have said time and time again that if women want to stay home let them .  that is not the issue .  the issue is that some women want more than that and deserve to be able to choose how to balance those aspects of their lives without having men like you dictate what their range of choices should be .  have you left your career to stay home with your kids ?  probably not-- so what you have to say about it is of limited value .  you would rather oppress people with your silly one-size fits all policies than to allow women the real freedom to do as they choose .  obviously you think very little of women ' s intelligence to choose for themselves . 
__label__1 the media has a lot to answer for ,  especially those glossy magazines for women .  there are a lot of articles about women having everything ,  excellent job ,  wonderful kids ,  wonderful husband and friends .  unfortunately ,  in the real world ,  most intelligent women who read the articles and would like to aspire to these great heights ,  just do not have the same support or money as the women highlighted in the magazine articles . 
__label__1 what we want is an equal freedom for men and women to make various choices about how to arrange commitments and responsibilities towards family and career .  this is not just a women ' s issue .  men suffer even greater discrimination in a work environment for wanting to take time out for family purposes ,  or for wanting to work part time .  and until more men start leaving the office at 5pm  ( or 3pm !  )  to pick up kids from daycare ,  or taking on part time positions to spend more time with family ,  it will not become an acceptable model in society .  in a broader context ,  companies need to realise that work-life balance is critical  ( not optional )  for a healthy workforce ,  male of female .  a more flexible way of working is required .  i think in this regard switzerland is ahead of places like the usa where the work-til-you-drop culture is still entrenched .  "having it all" is also not possible for anyone .  every choice has an opportunity cost ,  and this must be accepted at an individual level .  equality at the level of society means that men and women should not be differentially treated only on the basis of their gender . 
__label__1 @ef .  .  . why are you staying in a country that you feel does not benefit you ?  how does your swiss spouse feel about your continuous complaining about his country ?  switzerland has "3" cities in the top 10 best cities in the world to live ,  are any of those cities ,  you say you ' ve lived in; however ,  i have my doubts that you have ,  on that list ?  of course ,  there are other countries that have adequate standards of living but switzerland happens to be one of the top ?  are you trying to deny that ?  as far as foreigners and work are concerned ,  switzerland is beginning to change that .  .  . finally .  the swiss mistake was accepting the schengen agreement ,  but that is about to change ,  they have already put some restrictions on people from certain countries recently .  foreigners come to switzerland because "there is work . " you can always run over to spain ,  portugal ,  or greece .  .  . do they have work ?  everyone wants to flock to switzerland because it is so well managed and there is plenty of work ,  in most respects .  switzerland is a country with high standards and many just aren ' t used to that i do not care how "well traveled a person claims to be . "

__label__1 i love having conversations with the fanatics .  it stops me getting bored .  still ,  some of the comments on here and elsewhere in swiss media make it very clear why the status quo will never change .  if i had a franc for every "if you don ' t like it ,  leave" comment ,  i ' d be a millionaire by now . 
__label__1 the world can still be fixed ,  but drastic ,  unpopular action needs to be taken for us to survive . 
__label__1 still looking forward to some intellectual input from swiss women .  maybe you can ' t count ,  but it seems that dj wins the prize for number of irrelevant posts with little fact and since he isn ' t a woman i find it a bit revealing of his lack of respect for women .  but ,  i will take you at your word .  .  .  you are a happy swiss woman ,  right ?  now ,  tell me why others need to be just like you or something is wrong with them ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  to use the only word dj seems capable of spelling: lol ,  lol ,  lol ! 
__label__1 switzerland is about 50 years behind western europe when it comes to women ' s rights .  there is still the feeling that a woman ' s place is at home .  looking at the percentage of swiss men married to women from asian countries ,  one can conclude that is what the swiss men still want - a housewife .  what is needed are pre-school child-care facilities at work and lunches provided at school ,  so children don ' t need to go home at lunchtimes .  until then ,  nothing will change . 
__label__1 americans work because that ' s what they do ,  they ' re worker bees .  i understand one parent staying home with the kids before they enter school but when they ' re old enough for school it ' s time to get out of their way and let them get on with their lives .  and just because you stay home with your kids doesn ' t make you morally superior . 
__label__1 "having it all . " what an appeal the the ignorant and selfish part of  ( wo ) man .  anyone with any sense understands it is impossible to have it all .  just shows you how catered women are in our societies . 
__label__1 you are being silly now .  no one anywhere in the world can just "do as they choose .  ! " .  .  . lol i think you have much deeper issues that you are not taking care of and being a woman is a very small part of that .  .  . lol
__label__1 many working swiss women marry a man simply so that he can stay at home and look after the house and children ,  taking the role of women .  this is what my ex expected from me .  she is twice divorced now ,  still looking for her slave .  what do you think about men staying at home dj ?  what does your wife think ? 
__label__0 it ' s true that we have been modifying plants and their genes for a long time but we ' re doing it through selective breeding .  there is an enormous difference between selective breeding and inserting genes from fish ,  spiders and other animals ,  which is what gm companies do .  biotech companies force genes into plants that would never be able to happen in nature .  nature never saw gm crops in the billions of years of evolution and therefore does not know how to deal with them .  gm crops go against nature ,  and for scientists to say that they are benign is a flat out lie .  period . 
__label__0 there is a significant difference between transgenic genes and those discovered from selective breeding ,  but the process may not create results as unnatural as you suggest .  for example ,  because of the widespread use of glyphosate resistant crops farmers have been spreading the chemical on their fields to kill weeds at a greater rate ,  which has in tern put a selective breeding process on the weeds ,  resulting in weeds developing the same traits as the gm crops .  so although nature never saw gm crops in billions of years ,  it did see freak mutations ,  which are essentially the same thing .  gmos are not necessarily benign ,  but most examples on the market are ,  and have undergone many tests to prove so before entering the market .  in other words its not a flat out lie ,  just misleading ,  as gmos have the potential to be very dangerous ,  but those on the market really are fine ,  with the possible exception of bt products . 
__label__0 i know the subject well enough to relise that it could never work !  decisions made from the bottom up !  what happens when someone disagrees with that decision .  it would have to be forced upon them .  you would then have some super sub-libertarian movement to counter the libertarian movement .  at some point in a persons life you have to accept that you cant have it all your own way ,  because your way is not my way .  maybe we should have anti anarchist rally ' s and meetings just to keep the balance .  i ' m reminded of a story of the black clothed and booted anarchist standing at the bus stop complaining about the lateness of the bus !  by the way ,  i did not criticise ,  simply made a statement ,  and who are you to think i am not educated on the subject ? 
__label__0 @lynx :- )  we lost a lot of money and assets trying to get an apartment legally .  rent and unforeseen billing  ' extras '  has put strain on our income stream .  but geneva is a great city to be in ,  we are enjoying the environment despite all the challenges .  i am sure that the problem will be corrected in a typical swiss efficient manner . 
__label__0 it is not always the cost of the guide that brings foreign guides into ch .  friendships and referals .  i hope many ch guides get to work in other countries and their costs i am sure would be competitive .  the benefit to having a local guide will never change .  .  . they understand their mountains far better then an outside ,  and that will alone protect your life ,  more ,  than saving a few sfr . 
__label__0 i love the swiss bank system .  here in norway ,  the taxes are really high ,  so many of us use the swiss banks to place money : ) 
__label__0 excuse me for a moment while i laugh hysterically .  .  .  .  and just what kind of cheap capital was canada built on  ( and the us ,  and ,  and .  .  .  )  ?  stolen land anyone ,  for starters ?  at least switzerland was never involved in imperialist / colonialist hubris which has come back to haunt much of europe and north america in terms of stolen lives and property .  switzerland has a long tradition of privacy: the state can only go so far ,  which is very healthy for its citizens .  and here we are talking about the misuse of privacy to hide money ,  which is really only worthless pieces of paper anyway .  so take a good look in the mirror before delivering sermons to switzerland . 
__label__0 switzerland should absolutely not give up it ' s banking traditions .  more than ever there is a need to stand up for privacy ,  which should not be confused with "secrecy" .

__label__0 the usa is basiclly a military dictatership now .  what else can you call a country where the military gets $500 billion us dollars in yearly funding when the usa has a big national debt ?  then the usa military only takes action in countries where there are natural resources the usa wants like oil .  the npa burned a mindanao house i owned in july 2012 an shot my relations .  i asked the us government for us troups in mindanao ,  i have not got this yet ,  but there are us troups there now just not enough .  how can i invest in mindanao business in the province an have people burn my buildings ?  no usa investor will do this .  its sad but i guess you have to lower the population of bad people so someday the good people can work live their lives .  in usa if men when in the mountains killed people they would be hunted down with dogs and police .  we do have many robbers in usa they call them tax collectors . 
__label__0 so you know the wealth of the state but you don ' t have any idea how poor the people are compared to other states in malaysia .  the infrastructure is very bad ,  water supply the worst in the country ,  a lot of people been discriminated .  where the money goes ?  you can come to sabah and find out .  talk to the people .  most of them won ' t shocked with this news .  me ,  myself hoping for a better leader in sabah .  . 
__label__0 i don ' t understand why this case kept appearing . 
__label__0 you seem to not know how musa does business .  unless his family has 30% of a major venture  ( hotels ,  logging )  then the venture is not approved .  the cm is never on the agreement ,  but family members are .  he is popular because he controls the media in sabah ,  and the media reports favorably which influences opinion .  but the sabah growth would have occurred anyway ,  with him or without him .  i can assure you that a venture with which i was associated ,  declined by musa ,  would have provided 12 , 000 jobs and a lot of taxes and benefits - but we would not give musa a share - so we received a letter saying "we regret that we cannot accede to your request" .  had we cut his family in the outcome would have perhaps been different . 
__label__0 even the world respected icac also unable to prove that musa aman involved in this money laundering .  . 
__label__0 sure musa aman may have "saved" sabah from the brink of financial dilemma but that doesn ' t mean he didn ' t do what he ' s being accused of !  a puffer fish is a source of food but it could kill you if you don ' t know how to cook it .  so stop being such idiots by taking sides already .  let the swiss get down to business .  i am malaysian and i know how the corrupt the government is . 
__label__0 sabah’s turnaround in recent years has been one big feel-good story for the entire nation ,  which had virtually written off the state as a laggard in the post-liberalisation race for development .  but the advent of musa aman as the chief minister started to bring about a gradual change in the people’s perception .  for a change ,  sabah began to hit the headlines with positive stories .  from a remarkable fall in the crime graph to women empowerment  , and from deportation of hundreds of thousands of illegals sneaking in from the east-coast to drastic action against timber thieves ,  the state has started to shed its woeful image .  its growth rate also jumped to a phenomenal 7 per cent .  still ,  sabah could not afford to count itself among the developed states of the nation ,  primarily because of the dearth of industries in the state .  industrialists remained wary ,  often due to the power scenario ,  giving musa aman’s rivals a reason to mock his claims on the development front . 
__label__0 orca may well be surprised by the number of comments ,  mostly by malaysians and wonder why .  well ,  to be brief: the malaysian government takes no action in matters of corruption involving their own people; the local press is hampered in its freedom of expression; the commentators are employed by the malaysian government to counter any negative reporting in foreign publications  ( which the malaysian government cannot control ) ; lastly ,  malaysians are frustrated by the rampant corruption in their country which their own courts do nothing about .  so ,  you see the result here .  switzerland is of course not accountable for the ongoing corruption around the globe ,  however ,  it is accountable for the actions of swiss banks working in complicity with corrupt individuals .  currently ,  there is a court case being conducted in france which like this is the only recourse open for malaysians to seek justice ,  as it is not given to them in their own justice system . 
__label__0 please get on with using these lands and save your lovely green environment .  in mumbai since last two decades ,  lands which earlier housed close to a hundred textile mills and other industries have been used for numerous housing projects albeit ignoring the basic infrastructure the city offers  ( or has the ability to offer )  .  while this is true for the indian  ' planning '  ,  i would not expect the same mistake in switzerland . 
__label__1 do you have a legitimate point you would like to make ?  if not ,  go troll somewhere else .  since you can ' t enlighten us on what goes into making up the calculation ,  why don ' t you stick to your day job where you don ' t have to think much and you can do the same thing over and over again for 50yrs and pretend it is exciting ?  the writer of the article should only focus on the trend in unemployment rate in ch or explain the huge discrepancies in rates between countries rather than implying that ch must be doing such a good job vis a vis others .  .  .  is it really ?  i don ' t think the article proves anything clearly .  in any event ,  so goes europe so eventually will go ch-- it ' s just a matter of time . 
__label__0 it ' s not just the high prices .  it ' s also the tight timetable schedules .  for example ,  connecting trains leave within minutes of another train arriving .  if the train is late or if you walk slowly ,  you miss your connection .  also ,  fellow passengers are annoying - screaming kids ,  tinny music from headphones ,  lunatics out for the day making trouble ,  quiet areas on trains not quiet .  i used to love going by train .  now i drive .

__label__1 podnoszenie poprzeczki kursu franka z 1 , 2 jest to jedyna droga żeby naprawic zbyt późną swoją reakcję w celu bronienia kursu ,  gdyż snb mógł dolny limit kursu wprowadzić 1 ,  4 ,  a nawet 1 ,  5 ,  gdyby tylko wcześniej zareagował .  utrzymywanie tego kursu kosztowałoby go tyle samo ,  co obecnie ,  ale z drugiej strony można powiedzieć ,  że lepiej późno jak w cale .  frak szwajcarski przez dziesięciolecia był powiązany najpierw z marką niemiecką ,  a po później z euro .  obojętnie ,  więc ile euro kosztowało w stosunku do dolara między euro i frankiem zawsze była mniej więcej taka sama różnica .  http: /  / www . michalasman . bblog . pl / 
__label__0 kudos to emil ,  romania  ( reply to andy )  - you hit the nail on its head .  concerning often cited comments on pensions there seems to be a clear misunderstanding on the exchange rate effect .  according to a recent reuters report ,  total swiss pension funds represent some 400 billion francs .  the swiss capital market is tiny by international comparison and is available only for a small fraction for the needs of our pension funds .  consequently ,  they have no other choice but investing internationally and in the swiss real estate market .  although  ( part of )  foreign currencies are hedged back to the franc ,  it is an illusion to believe that the overvalued franc ,  as a consequence of the debt crisis ,  is beneficial .  on the contrary ,  collateral risks  ( downgrading of the borrower ,  etc .  )  potentially reduce further the already slim returns .

__label__0 well ,  i do not really mind about more casinos .  they are not distracting like radar traps on the road .  both are meant to be money-making machines for the state .  there are certainly less boring and costly ways of wasting your time .  yet ,  you cannot argue about taste .  .  . 
__label__0 that ' s funny ,  most americans think the un is a useless organization that caters to third world despots .  if the un is so unpopular ,  why does it continue to exist ?  couldn ' t the money spent to maintain a bunch of overpriced and useless beaurocrats in two of the most expensive cities on the planet  ( geneva and new york )  be better spent somewhere else ? 
__label__0 i disagree .  the problem is that we have two parties to begin with ,  each with their own direction that they want to take the country .  the idea was if we have more ideas that would lead to a better society ,  because the best ideas would be at he fore due to honest individuals seeking to better the nation .  what has in fact happened is a balkanization based upon ideological grounds that has produced a stale mate of sorts .  two parties that are only slightly different in terms of modernity but fundamentally radically different .  you think americans have learned the value of living inside their means ?  we must be living in two different americas ,  because i see the very opposite .  americans are incredibly hedonistic . 
__label__0 @lynx: have you ever thought about or even considered that you just might be one of the causes and reason of the anti-foreigner attitude by the swiss majority ?  your frequent derogatory comments about switzerland and their citizens on this website certainly exhibits your addiction and inclination which leads me to believe that .  i suggest that you search for and move to a country and home to your liking and contentment . 
__label__0 switzerland has more foreigners ?  ?  ?  i seriously doubt that ,  if you consider numbers .  percentage-wise ,  maybe ,  but that ' s only because switzerland has such a low population anyway  ( less than london ,  for example )  .  as for an invasion - sorry ,  wrong again dj .  the swiss invited the foreigners into their country .  no one has invaded here  ( unless you count those who have sneaked in via schengen )  .

__label__0 as some of the comments here reflect ,  many people have not bothered to educate themselves on the facts .  first ,  bradley birkenfeld never sold any information to anybody .  .  . not to any person or to any government .  second ,  he did protest internally at ubs regarding their illegal practices while he was still working there .  these efforts were documented in a financial times article from august ,  2008 .  but he was stonewalled by executives at the bank and told to be quiet about this illegal scheme .  there was a corrupt cover-up at ubs .  so ,  he resigned from the bank and brought this entire matter to the attention of the one entity that had the power to bring ubs to justice .  .  . the united states government .  so ,  the next time one feels the urge to comment on this story ,  it is best to place your anger aside and examine the facts .

__label__0 graffiti in switzerland has gotten shocking .  which i guess is the point .  .  . young people  ( swiss and others )  are emulating the styles of urban america and germany ,  and the authorities look the other way ,  perhaps with the idea that graffiti will  ' loosen up '  swiss culture .  unfortunately ,  this aspect of cultural decay gets more aggressive with tolerance .  here in central oregon our cities and towns are very clean ,  because we simply do not tolerate graffiti ,  but every day the trains roll through ,  covered in very dark negative graffiti  ( skulls ,  etc .  )  which happens in the large cities . 
__label__0 i ' ve visited switzerland 2-3 times yearly for the past 5 years ,  and agree that the graffiti problem has increased .  my impression of the swiss is that they are perhaps a little too clean .  the lady who lives in the house next to my friend vacuums the rocks outside her front door !

__label__0 typical .  attack corporations first .  i agree with you but that is a just a superficial aspect of the problem .  the corporations just provide something that people demand .  they didn ' t create it .  the main problem is the people themselves who smoke and the "freedom" or "right" to smoke .

__label__0  ' let ' s get out of there '  and  ' why the hell are we helping the americans '  are very natural responses .  the basic question comes down to which is better: being neutral and uninvolved or engaging with the rest of the world ,  no matter how unsavoury .  our presence at the un has broadened swiss influence in the world and i truly believe that is a good thing for the world ,  not just us swiss .  but on the other hand ,  my other country ,  canada ,  just broke off diplomatic relations with iran ,  and for good reasons .   ( iran was using their embassy in ottawa as a spy base ,  and meanwhile not even taking the calls of our diplomats in tehran ,  so why pay to have them there ?  ) 
__label__0 they should all be arrested and deported . 
__label__0 it ' s true that some people vote emotionally ,  but no one is obliged to vote so it ' s just a minority that does that .  it ' s also true that people have been voting the same way for lots of years ,  and they way they voted contributed to make switzerland the country it is today .  i am not discontent with the result ,  so for me ,  it ' s an acceptable danger .  much better than systematic and legal corruption ,  which is the alternative .

__label__0 oh my .  will the calls for state regulation never end ?  whenever people ,  who seem to have no understanding of economics whatsoever ,  are of the opinion that something is wrong in this world ,  they immediately insist on the state to ban or to regulate; problem solved .  the less fortunate citizens of this planet would benefit from a true free-market system . 
__label__0 this recently from reuters: "young men who had smoked marijuana recreationally were twice as likely to be diagnosed with testicular cancer than men who have never used marijuana . " the british lung foundation has also recently reported studies show that cannabis is 20 times more dangerous than tobacco .  sorry if that bursts *your* bubble . 
__label__0 this is a tiny step in the right direction .  if switzerland were a free country ,  the state would have absolutely no role in banning or regulating private consumption of any kind .   ( and needless to say ,  no one would be forced to pay for another’s medical expenses ,  in this case due to cannabis ,  through any kind of state welfare system .  ) 
__label__0 patent troll under fire ?  :d
__label__0 i ' d say that black sheeps are in many places and not only in switzerland and that is the truth just because the laws have been changed in swiss banks does not mean it is still hidden there ,  again im sure there are other banks / financ .  institutions in other countries that carry hidden funds; they have just not been found . 
__label__0 the less oversight by governments or indpendent boards ,  leads to more control not less .  more red tape and rules and laws .  .  . block progress .  .  .  . dont change what is working and is reliable . 
__label__0 they did extensive charity .  hero seems fine for me .  i guess the nihilists are out today . 
__label__0 that is an illusion and not reality .  this action will only finish switzerland off as a financial center and promore the usa banks .  the new offshore banking centers have already moved to asia .  this is where the governments have a backbone and are not intimidated by the usa .  this is the end of swiss banking
__label__0 no ,  they should stop .  bern still doesn ' t seem to realise that the goal of the us and germany is not transparency ,  but a weakening of the swiss finance industry to benefit the us and germany - it ' s nothing more than economic warfare against switzerland to divert the attention of their own corrupt practices .  let ' s not forget that wall street caused the crisis  ( yet again )  ,  not switzerland .  let ' s not forget that german banks are very happy to help swiss evade taxes .  switzerland has given enough - time to grow a backbone and demand something in return . 
__label__0 it continues to amaze me when people think it ' s fine to force others to inhale their smoke .  if they were sitting next to a heroin addict who insisted on sharing their needle ,  the same people would be outraged .  cigarettes kill -- the evidence is overwhelming for both primary and second-hand smoke .  and yet ,  it ' s apparently fine with two-thirds of swiss voters for one group of people to poison another group . 
__label__0 no ,  it was about smoking ,  the effect on non-smokers by a minority ,  and the inconsistent application throughout switzerland of what should be a basic healthright ,  i . e to not have to suffer somebody elses cancerous and unpleasanet smoke .  .   ( whether working or otherwise )  .  that it was somehow considered an imposition on each canton ' s democracy and independence is simply a smoke screen by the pro-smoking gastro lobby and which the anti-smoking lobby missed / under-estimated .  the swiss government and people should ,  as somebody above said ,  be ashamed of themselves .  they government especially a duty of care towards their citizens and they missed a great opportunity to correct what is a pretty awful situation .  . 
__label__0 max .  fair point but only regarding the autonomy of swiss cantons ,  i speak with some knowledge of the swiss system being married in switzerland to a wonderful swiss girl and living happily in the "land of the big sky" for over 50 years .  we visit switzerland numerous times and still am amazed at the number of swiss who still smoke - especially young girls .  we ,  in canada ,  dealt with this issue of "smokers lounges" years ago and it was settled when the federal government gave support to the provinces - and yes our provinces have the same autonomy as swiss cantons .  it is no longer an issue .  i have always maintained that the swiss are the most logical folk on earth but on this vote they have told the world the opposite - just read world press comments . 
__label__0 all of this is "former" swiss this and former swiss that .  none of the men are swiss and no longer work in a swiss bank ,  so why is this news for switzerland ? 
__label__0 no appeals should be allowed for rejected applications .  it just overloads our juridical system ,  cost money to tax payers and is a nifty loophole for abusers of the system .

__label__0 nick the greek  .  .  .  .  .  i could not have stated it any better .  the blinkers worn by the swiss masses is beyond comprehension .  the same could be said for the average swiss income ,  said to be chf5300 . 00 monthly .  if one were to remove all income earners who earn salaries over 150k annually ,  that average income will represent 80% of all the "other" workers and the mean monthly income will probably be between 30 and 40% less  .  .  .  .  .  @ chf3000 . 00 maximum .  probably still higher than the eu but then incomparable when comparing cost of living where the buying power would be approximately 20% less than the eu . 
__label__0 yes ,  i support sex education .  i support self discipline .  i support taking personal responsibility for the life that one has helped create . 
__label__0 it ' s exclusively the woman ' s body ,  so exclusively her decision .  until men are responsible for their sperm they have no right to a voice in the matter !  another issue to think about; we are already struggling with massive overpopulation and unsustainable growth .  more unwanted births create an even larger burden .  i don ' t see those arguing against choice giving any post partum or childhood support to mothers .  make the woman have the kid ,  but after that they could care less .  very self righteous and short sighted . 
__label__0 bit surprised people condemning the banks not the super rich who are not even willing to pay interest on their savings .  poor people can ' t do that ,  they have to pay the interest and indeed hand over their saving as well .  sure is an upside down world .  why should it be a crime to report people committing a crime ? 
__label__0 what the critics forget to mention ,  most adults identify these films as pure fiction and enjoy the stunts ,  the scenery as well as the gadgets .  sort of mickey mouse or bugs bunny for adults .  let ' s face it ,  the daily news show on tv is often a lot more violent because there it is for real . 
__label__0 this article is really interesting ,  but the section "genetically-modified plants: bane or blessing ? " is completely idiotic .  "these costs could be reduced by grouping farm operations in transgenic production zones ,  as is being done in some parts of portugal . " that ' s just not the way switzerland works !  everything is small ,  independent ,  and not run centrally by the government .  you can ' t just tell a farmer "ok you ' re in this zone so start producing this crop .  or move to the other side of the country . "

__label__0 i agree with chinese tour guide ,  but as far as food and services ,  it should be based on european standard not chinese .  if they come to europe they should try european meal ,  food etc .  ,  not chinese .  service should be based solemnly on european standard .  why europe has to adjust to chinese service ,  i do not understand ?  let them be more educated and adjust to culture of the nation they are in .  simple as it is . 
__label__0 i suffered from bulima about 25 years ago .  at the time looking back it was about chronic low self esteem ,  which i still suffer from today .  however as a young girl ,  i could not handle the whole thing about relationships ,  and felt awkward ,  fat and ugly .  i think some was about control as well as i had a controlling family and i wanted some kind of control over their control .  however as i have got older ,  whilst inside i have low esteem ,  i have learn to live with whom i am .  i have had counselling which was the first great step to managing my emotions ,  then i have just accepted more of whom i am .  i can live with it .  but for many many years i could not ,  i gorged ,  binged ,  pukked ,  and took laxatives .  i think i will have a bad relationship with food all my life but now conversely am overweight / obese and i still binge eat but without the rest of it .  so not really over it ,  but not as bad as i was . 
__label__0 my eating disorder began when my brother went to prison for the fourth time ,  i had lack of control of everything around me .  my mom was an alcoholic ,  and i felt as if everything i had to do had to be perfect ,  it began 2 years ago .  bullies at school ,  kept asking me why i wasn ' t as skinny as my best friend and why i wasn ' t as pretty ,  everyone around me was skinny and beautiful .  i was told the only way to be pretty is to be skinny ,  so i started of by going to the gym everyday after 2 hours of intense tennis practice and i ran for 3 hours straight ,  when my weight wasn ' t coming of fast enough ,  i decided i was gonna cut some of my food out ,  and then the weight started coming of a little faster ,  then i decided it wasn ' t fast enough so i cut everything out to wear i was only eating 200 to 300 calories a day and i did that for 2 months and i went from 197 to 143 .  and i told my mom that i was scared ,  and i went to a clinic .  i was just recently discharged from 9 weeks of intensive 24 hour care .  and i am at 156 ,  i still struggle with an ed ,  but i am not gonna let it rule my life !  and i still am doing outpatient 1 a week .  and one of the rules is if i go under 5 pounds of my goal weight i go back for 2 weeks . 
__label__1 the power of jairus’ daughter  ( book excerpt taken from “thin enough: my spiritual journey through the living death of an eating disorder” )  by: sheryle cruse could a simple bible story spark eating disorder recovery ?  well ,  for me ,  it did .  the account of jairus’ daughter ,  found in mark 5:35-43 ,  became the catalyst to hope ,  life ,  freedom ,  and yes ,  my recovery .  i chronicle my eating disorder odyssey ,  recovery included ,  in my book ,  “thin enough: my spiritual journey through the living death of an eating disorder . ” from this scriptural passage ,  i encountered tangible proof that god’s word was relevant and applicable .  i learned some good news ,  all right .  nothing’s too difficult; no one’s too impossible for god .  i saw that in jairus’ daughter .  i have ,  likewise ,  seen it in my own life ,  as well as the lives of others .  and this simple bible story is now a declaration of hope to all young girls and women ,  dealing with eating disorders ,  food ,  weight and body image issues .  you ,  too ,  can arise !  “little girl ,  i say unto you ,  arise”  ( mark 5:41 )  .  i had done and been so many horrible things .  as far as i was concerned ,  i was on my way to hell .  but i couldn’t shake the thoughts of this story .  was there hope that i wasn’t doomed after all ?  i became intrigued with the story of jairus’ daughter .  it wouldn’t leave me alone .  my soul was in a tug of war .  for so long ,  i’d just accepted believing i was bound for hell .  as upsetting as this belief was ,  it had become familiar to me .  now ,  all of a sudden ,  these familiar thoughts had competition .  maybe hope was possible for me again .  i’d never really been much of a bible reader .  i’d look at the thick book and think ,  “that’s too much reading .  it’s too difficult—too many thous and thines—and besides ,  it doesn’t really apply to me . ” but now ,  it applied .  of course ,  i had no clue where to find the story .  i had to do some hunting .  i narrowed it down to the new testament .  hey ,  that’s where the stories about jesus are found ,  right ?  sooner or later ,  i’d have to come across this little girl .  as i plowed through the bible ,  i found a scripture that summed up who i was and what i was going through .  “lord ,  i believe; help my unbelief ! ” —mark 9:24: that was me !  i knew i couldn’t be enough ,  love enough ,  believe enough ,  and have faith enough unless god helped me .  when i began to feel that i wasn’t hell-bound after all ,  i experienced an opposing tug in this battle .  another thought popped up: “how do you know you even believe in god ,  or want to believe in god ? ” this scared me .  my life showed me repeatedly that i couldn’t trust my own heart .  maybe this desperation for god was a new lie .  i decided to fight as hard as i could ,  not because i was nobly seeking after god ,  but because i was scared to death of my life without him .  i had to find this story of jairus’ daughter ,  but more than that ,  i had to find god himself .  the guilt and shame over my past took a backseat to my new urgency in finding god .  some days ,  i felt like i was saved and on my way to a wonderful life with god .  other days ,  i left the lights on and slept clutching my bible for dear life ,  like a child clutches a teddy bear .  i cried .  i laughed .  i shouted .  i cowered .  i whispered and whimpered .  but through it all ,  i kept praying ,  “god ,  be real to me ,  be real . ” and i kept reading the bible .  i finally found the story in mark 5:35-43 .  it started out with desperate parents wanting their daughter healed .  i could relate .  my own family wanted me cured ,  fixed .  in the bible story ,  jairus ,  a ruler of the synagogue ,  begged jesus to come and heal his daughter ,  who was at the point of death .  jesus agrees to go with him .  but before jesus could get there ,  some people came from jairus’ house and told jairus not to bring jesus; there was no longer any point .  “your daughter is dead: why trouble the teacher any further ? ” —mark 5:35 i could relate .  there were so many people who had given up on me .  i heard their voices and frustrated sighs ,  “it’s hopeless ,  she’ll never change . ” but then ,  as i continued reading ,  it jumped out at me: “as soon as jesus heard the word that was spoken ,  he said to the ruler of the synagogue ,  ‘do not be afraid; only believe . ’” —mark 5:36 he ignored their comments ?  he didn’t listen to them ?  hope started in me as i continued to read .  he wouldn’t let anyone else come along with him ,  to argue with him .  i looked at my life .  for so long ,  my life was about seeking a substitute for god ,  instead of seeking god himself .  i’d turned to food ,  accomplishment ,  image ,  people ,  and things .  but it was jesus this whole time .  jesus was my answer ,  my answer to pain ,  to fear ,  to father .  “i am the way ,  the truth ,  and the life .  no one comes to the father ,  except through me . ” —jesus speaking in john 14:6 jesus entered the house where people were weeping and wailing .  he said to them ,  “the child is not dead ,  but sleeping , ”  ( mark 5:39 )  i thought about how death had become my life .  i’d focused on death as the beauty ,  the answer .  stuffing and starving myself was death .  bingeing ,  purging ,  punishing ,  all were death .  but what if these words could apply to me and the death i was going through ?  what if anorexia ,  bulimia ,  compulsive eating—what if none of them were the final word ?  what if jesus was ?  what if the bible really was true ?  i read on through mark 5:41: “then he took the child by the hand ,  and said to her ,  “talitha ,  cumi , ” which is translated ,  “little girl ,  i say to you ,  arise . ” and she did !  what if i could arise from all of this too ?  what if i could wake up and live beyond anorexia ,  bulimia ,  overeating ,  food ,  weight ?  and then ,  to top it all off ,  i read mark 5:43 ,  jesus “said that something should be given her to eat . ” you mean jesus wants me to eat ?  not starve ,  not stuff myself either ,  but eat something ?  i didn’t have to starve or binge ?  “something”—everything in moderation ?  you mean jesus said it first ?  “for my thoughts are not your thoughts ,  nor are your ways my ways ,  says the lord .  for as the heavens are higher than the earth ,  so are my ways higher than your ways ,  and my thoughts than your thoughts . ” —isaiah 55:8-9 it was during this slow ,  gradual process i began ,  not only to learn ,  but to live the wonderful reality of john 8:32: “the truth shall make you free . ” of all of the things i’ve been ,  i never thought free would be one of them .  copyright © 2012 by sheryle cruse

__label__0 this is all nonsense .  the reason most physical gold passes through switzerland is the same reason that the mighty rich keep their money there and is the same reason why switzerland is never attacked militarily .  it belongs to the 0 . 1% elite of this world who have ensured that it is a safe haven for their looted wealth .  gold is the ultimate money and is no surprise that most of it in private hands is actually stored in switzerland . 
__label__0 i would say the main reason switzerland has never been attacked militarily is that every household is well armed and knows how to shoot .  a very dissuading thought for any would-be attackers . 
__label__0 anand ,  you are confusing the people with the state; do you honestly believe that people want to have their savings eroded by inflation ?  the only entity that has ever gained by the issuing of fiat currency is the state ,  and it has come at a great cost to ordinary working people .  in my experience ,  few people understand the nature of the fiat monetary system; if they did ,  i’m certain they would oppose it fiercely .

__label__1 swiss banks ,  especially the biggest ones ,  rape ,  pillage and betray their employees daily !  and when not being subjected to such treatment via direct assult ,  simply having to tolerate daily the visionless idiocy of inept ,  incompetent middle management is just further mindnumbing brainwashing .

__label__0 anything that consumes more energy to produce than it produces is a waste of time ,  money and effort .  food prices will jump drastically this year due to the drought in america ,  yet president obama continues to push the green fuels which takes food off the table and produces less energy than used to create it .  truly absurd policies .

__label__0 when i was a teenager ,  i would catch blue crabs by tying a piece of chicken to some twine and throwing it into the water .  the crabs would latch on to the free chicken and not let go .  i would have to shake them off into a bucket .  if i had only one crab in the bucket ,  i had to worry about it climbing out .  once i had more than one crab in the bucket ,  whenever one crab would reach near the lip of the bucket ,  the other crabs would pull it back into the bottom of the bucket .  when i read the following from the side column to this article ,  i thought of the free chicken and crabs in a bucket .  "the organisation for economic co-operation and development  ( oecd )  last january called on switzerland to abolish the lump sum tax system . " doesn ' t anyone wonder what is so horrible about the lump sum tax system that other countries want switzerland to abolish it ?  how does it harm other countries for switzerland to have this ?  you know the answer .

__label__0 the time to deal with these issues was back when the foreign media were seizing upon those black sheep posters and using them to portray switzerland as some kind of unreconstructed nazi-banker nation .  after that ,  letting unreconstructed types speak their minds wasn ' t going to do any further harm ,  was it ?  it couldn ' t ,  really ,  could it ?  the horse hasn ' t just bolted; it ' s lived a long and vigorous life and died of old age - the only advantage of all these cries is that we now have a better idea where it ' s buried .

__label__0 @mohammed ,  belgium: switzerland certainly has become and always was much cleaner than belgium ever was with their african colonies ,  including many other eu member nations with former colonies i might add .  if you even are a belgian national you ought to know that:"leopold ii was absolute ruler of congo .  his rule was brutal and millions of congolese died as a result" .  now the fact is no ammunition factory ever existed or operated within the city of schaffhausen .  the city was bombed by usaaf b-24 liberators and by mistake according to accepted chronicles and not by the british raf .  so get your facts straight before you make any further derogatory ,  unsubstatiated and unwarranted comments on and about the wwii history of switzerland . 
__label__0 to sun and miracle: well stated disclosures and commentary by each of you .  thank you .  don ' t they ,  some of the military  ' and '  economic / financial powerful ,  and in some cases now ,  languishing and declining nations of this world like to go after and beat up on the little guys ?  by now ,  everyone ought to know or be aware who they ,  the powerful are .  i could include and place the eu  ' fraternity '  into this category of bullies and aggressors now .  poor switzerland is and has been blackmailed ,  threatened and condemned from all sides and angles for decades by some individuals ,  organizations and nations with ,  in the majority of cases ,  unwarranted ,  unjustifiable ,  exaggerated and falsified accusations .  are these aggressors conceivably acting out of desperation or diverting attention away from their own domestic problems and / or their obscure and questionable activities ?

__label__0 a nation is never brutal .   ( and i say the same thing when fellow europeans tell me that americans are brutal )  only officialdoms / governments / presidents can be broutal ,  and most of them are - to a bigger or lesser extent .  we - the rest of the world - should perhaps ask ourselves if a nuclear programme is reason enough to deny a people food by imposing sanctions ?  sanctions which ,  just by the way ,  will do nothing to halt the nuclear developement but only worsen the poverty and hunger .  the usa ,  russia and israel already have so many nuclear eggs they could blow up ten universes . 
__label__0 this is a clear knee-jerk reaction .  going through with plans that are not thought through ?  without the vote of the people ?  plans that risk hundreds of millions on a "maybe it will work" ?  this is not swiss !  !  ! 
__label__0 read this: " .  .  . and imported clean energy .  .  . " .  makes you wonder which of our neighboring countries will have enough excess capacity to export during peak consumption hours ,  let alone green electricity .  according to latest reports we should not count on france because excess capacity  ( nuke reactors !  )  will eventually vanish over the coming years .  indeed ,  it will take years to replace all those widely used electric heating systems .  obviously our energy experts do not think so and are about to build generators powered by natural gas .  where to build the additional 970 wind-farms ?  close to agglomerations they are a nuisance for the residents and on mountain tops not only ugly but also harmful to migrating birds .  .  . 
__label__0 exactly the point i am making .  however ,  this is not the cas ehere .  therefore mums  ( or dads )  cannot work a proper half day  .  .  .  ie  .  .  .  8 - 12 mornings ,  she  ( he )  would be home for the afternoon when kids get home at 1 or 2 pm .  it is here that there would be less spent on day care .  there is always ,  of course ,  the choice to work full time and therefore ,  engender the costs associated ,  but from here it is a personal choice .  at the moment ,  many families simply do not have the choice and having no choice ,  the second income is eaten by all the costs that are incurred .  "part time" is only in title ,  it is not in practice and therefore in reality force spending in day care structures and the like .  not many schools here in switzerland offer the mid day meal ,  hence many kids go home for lunch and return after for the afternoon schooling session .  my kids finish regular schooling after 3pm 2 days a week ,  one day at noon and the other two at 2pm .  but every day they break up at 11h50 and come home for lunch and return to school to resume afternoon classes at 1h20pm  ( except wednesday )  . 
__label__0 more proof that human trafficking / slavery has followed the path of legalized prostitution .  there just are not enough women who choose this profession to fill the demand .  any man who seeks out prostitution is complicit in this modern form of slavery .  switzerland can no longer pretend that legalization of prostitution helps women . 
__label__0 i know this by going out and meeting women .  my regular bars over the years have become populated by supermodels ,  who are obviously not swiss .  this is great until you find out the real reason they are there . 
__label__0 @rouslan: may i point out one fact ,  being my opinion and contemplation ,  that possibly the majority of swiss males have turned away from the high percentage of young and even middle age swiss women with their metallized  ( pierced )  and tattooed face ,  ears ,  nose ,  eyebrows ,  cheeks ,  lips and tongue .  the swiss males might just prefer the natural and exotic looking foreign beauties for excitement and pleasure again .  i feel sorry for the many remaining and very beautiful swiss women that are seemingly not an easy pray and too hard to conquer .  .  ! 
__label__1 in my personal opinion ,  an average swiss women isn ' t any uglier than an average brazilian ,  ukrainian etc .  woman .  : )  there is always a certain percentage of males who prefer to pay a girl instead of impressing her ,  and it ' s ok .  it has nothing to do with local females though .  .  .  it ' s another story altogether . 
__label__1 a bunch of useless dope heads making a point ,  what else ? 
__label__0 radical indeed: having read the article you suggest ,  i understand that you propose not only the end of central banks ,  but of national currencies too .  this would also involve the end of banking itself ,  except as the logistics of gold  ( which would involve promissory notes ,  merely as a practical necessity ,  but who might trust these ,  except when issued by monarchs ,  principalities or republics ?  )  .  a return to barter is always a possibility / necessity ,  but i imagine the lives of bank traders might well be incommoded by the need to bring the goats and chickens with them ,  and the trading floor could become even more slippery than ever .  seriously ,  who imagines that a non-currency life is even remotely desirable ,  and who except governments issues currencies that anyone believes in ?  can an issuing bank not be a central bank ?  of course ,  but then ,  what backs trust in the currency issued ?   ( and incidentally ,  why do you imagine that gold was ever considered desirable ,  except that pharaohs liked to be buried with it ?  ) 
__label__0 i live in france and i see how much damage the strike culture does to this country .  this society has a culture of clashes .  common sense and social dialogue has been lost on both sides .  company leaders don t feel social cohesion and workers have lost consideration for company leaders and creators .  if i was to create a company ,  france would be the last country i would choose .  strike should only be the last means ,  if dialogues are refused or leaders show nasty behaviour it must not be a means of pressure  !  switzerland must keep its culture of compromise and dialogue to attract companies that will reduce unemployment and contribute to switzerland ' s wealth . 
__label__0 i like all the answers  (  up to nov .  23  )  dialog works  ,  the proof is in the pudding  .  strikes are the equal of extortion .  losers all around  . 
__label__0 the collective labour contracts and dialogue between management and unions is a process the partners can be proud of .  it is a shining example for the world to see and is far more productive than many " mafia tactics " sorry to say so ,  used by labour organizer in other part of the world .  this dialogue has had as a result a much closer compensation gap between management and certified and educated professional labor . 
__label__0 us started the ball rolling .  .  . i gather you have not read reports and the new lately ?  us is trillions of dollars in debt ,  has lost its competitive edge ,  large companies are moving out ,  high unemployment ,  moral decay .  .  . and all the other toppings .  america has been on its way out since the last few decades .  asia is becoming the new economic hub and switzerland knows this .  in fact ,  switzerland is voted the number one competitive country in the world ,  way ahead of the us .  capitalism is not working for america .  .  . 
__label__0 that  ' black eye '  isn ' t real .  it was fabricated by the obama political camp to further stir up class envy and resentment .  the obama camp figures this will garner them votes .  it was promoted by the leftist media .  the  ' tax loopholes '  that the politicians love to demonize were in fact created by them .  the  ' loopholes '  are part of the tax code .  romney ' s tax returns were audited by the irs and passed muster as being legal .  by the way ,  at least 35 of president obama ' s aides are behind on their tax payments .  caught by the irs . 
__label__0 thank you .  good points .  at issue here is really that the united states taxes any income made by u . s .  citizens whether it is earned in the states or abroad .  u . s .  expats living in switzerland  ( or france or zimbabwe )  who put their foreign earnings into swiss bank accounts while living abroad have to declare their income annually  ( and pay taxes on the foreign income )  .  i imagine this is especially weird for those people who were born in the usa ,  but have never lived there .  they could certainly risk being accused for tax evasion !  i wonder what happens to them ? 
__label__0 i’m glad that you didn’t try to defend your earlier position on denaturalization .  it truly is an odious idea .  as long as the swiss state maintains a monopoly on the legal use of force within switzerland ,  i believe it does have a legitimate role in securing her borders .  that includes controlling immigration .  but as i’ve said before ,  switzerland already has a very strict immigration and naturalization regime ,  which has lead to the vast majority of immigrants being net contributors to the swiss economy  ( workers and their families )  .  furthermore ,  a high level of immigration is actually crucial for maintaining the standard of living swiss residents currently enjoy .  i do ,  however ,  agree with the general sentiment that the remainder—those migrants who are a net burden on society and have no productive prospects—needs to be minimized .  i have yet to form a well-defined opinion on how exactly that should be done ,  but what i do know is that the “stop-all-immigration-now” rhetoric makes little economic sense and only provides absurdity . 
__label__0 the eu is in recession ,  its markets are contracting ,  the economies are uncompetitive because they are all weighed down by inflated public sectors financed by very heavy taxation .  swiss exporters are smart ,  competitive ,  and have very sound balance sheets .  they are able to seek new markets in the growing economies ,  and so the importance of the eu to switzerland will greatly decrease over the next 5 years .

__label__0 positive discrimination is still discrimination against some other group .  appointment should be on merit only .  stockholders should sue if they are not convinced that appointments were made on merit . 
__label__0 yes ,  and in response to such pressure ,  the swiss should play hardball on the wave of european refugees flooding the country because they can not find work in the wonderful eu .  better to be an island in a raging sea ,  than a another bit of detritus on the eu beach .

__label__0 the idea that european law has "a certain primacy" is exactly why the swiss do not want to join .  politicians in brussels would not care for the swiss; they do not seem to care for any of their constituents in the eu .  the swiss value their sovereignty because they know how to run a profitable and cohesive nation .  as soon as you add the swiss into a conglomeration of 500 million other "citizens" ,  the swiss '  interests are suddenly lost .  brussels wants ch to join because the swiss economy is strong .  however ,  the absurd policies of the eu will ruin ch ,  just as they have ruined countless other countries .  it is a clear fact that switzerland would be a net contributor to the eu ,  so what ' s in it for the swiss citizens ? 
__label__0 long term presidents have a common tendency to forget that being a president is and always was meant to be just a job ,  as any other ,  harder and more responsible - as much as a tendency to often misunderstand themselves for messiahs or oscar winning show stars .  one year is long enough for one not to devolve from public to private purpose .  you are doing a great job - meaning ,  in this matter ,  as many other ,  you should not follow others - you should be followed by others . 
__label__0 you guys should leave it like that  !  !  it works just fine  !  !  switzerland is a benchmark on political administration  !  !  the power there ,  is dived on a different basis ,  there is a perfect balance on the swiss system . 
__label__0 yes ,  our country is a little paradise and that ' s why expats like to come here and very often choose to stay after retirement .  however ,  the authorities need to be attentive to the crime situation .  unfortunately ,  our country attracts criminal gangs from all neighbouring countries ,  as well as far-away places like nigeria .  our laws are too gentle ,  our courts too lenient ,  and our police is under-staffed . the cantons and the confederation need to take firm and stern measures asap ,  for the good of the citizens as well as to preserve the attractivity of switzerland for foreign firms and expats . 
__label__0 perhaps rules and regulations did not go far enough and this is the reason for the present state of corruption .  how many years has it taken to finally get serious about doping in sports .  we need less bleeding hearts ,  not more . 
__label__0 what are you doing for worldwide corruption ,  genocide ,  and human rights violations "in a lot of places ? " oh ,  so you want other people / countries to take care of someone else ' s problems so that you can feel better ?  i think swiss lack of  ( or very little of )  foreign aid policies is actually why the country is doing well .  so yes being concerned about one ' s own health  ( hence cheese labeling )  and the things that go on in their country is more important .  of course if you ' re a so inclined ,  after attempting fail at wit ,  maybe you can take up the cause yourself ? 
__label__0 they can rebrand it till the cows come home id rather eat chestnuts
__label__0 "a clean criminal record will also be necessary . " "young foreigners living illegally in switzerland .  .  . " what an oxymoron .  yes ,  because people who enter into a country illegally have a "clean record . " another attempt to change the country by the left of that said country .  sad . 
__label__0 yesterday ' s first working day with the new timetables was an utter catastrophe in the romandie region .  both my outward and return journeys from palezieux were delayed by 25 mins .  trains arrived with carriages shut down due to power faliure ,  so trains were crammed full .  bus times have changed to fit the new train timetable and people were just confused .  my daily commute from palezieux to geneva has increased by 16 mins ,  if i want to avoid changing at lausanne and joining in the stampede .  sorry to disappoint folks reading this from abroad ,  but swiss train travel ,  at least in my region ,  no longer lives up to the image of perfection it once enjoyed . 
__label__0 in the region dielsdorf .  the new timetables have made an existing issue so much worse that it adds at least 30 minutes to the journey time ,  if not a full hour ,  because in one direction buses only arrive 2 minutes before the train departs ,  and that situation persists for most of the evening .  all it takes is one passenger buying a bus ticket ,  or some traffic delay  ( normal during peak hours )  and passengers miss the connection - yet it is deemed perfectly acceptable to let a bus wait 15 minutes for a delayed train .  useless . 
__label__0 you pretend to know what happened ? 
__label__0 every democratic government should learn to accept criticism without resorting to heavy-handed measures .  in any democratic society ,  there will be people who agree or disagree with the government .  a government that allows debate and dissent is a sign of maturity ,  not weakness - something the lao government still needs to learn . 
__label__1 send her to afghanistan and let ' s see if she shows the same courage over there ! 
__label__0 yeah .  well enjoy you sharia zones in britain  ( we wouldn ' t want to promote "fear" )  .  britain isn ' t doing so well the last time i checked .  it isn ' t propaganda if it is true . 
__label__0 i meant these parties are stressing minor issues that are easy to pass at the ballot and escaping the real dilemmas .  i do not see how banning minerates in the uk would address the problem of extremsim  ( religious nor political )  .  i do not think many mulsims really care about this ban either .  this initiative is one in a series of tactics to gain political domination of one party .  how many minerate applications where there in switzerland at the time of the ban ?  how many immigrants where kicked out using the ausschaffungsinitiative ?  compare this to the flocks of incoming migrants after passing the expansion of eu initiative ,  and the increase in burglary .  these are some of many examples how direct democracy on issues on that level is creating conflicting laws with some that are rarely put into practice . 
__label__0 i appreciate professor ' s responses for this interviews but should also highlight events that are currently occurring in kachin state ,  in burma / myanmar today ,  affected by government army offensive war were affected and continuously impacted on civilians rights without any respect international humanitarian law to harmonize under international human rights norms which recognized by international community to survive in satiety &amp; dignity . 
__label__0 are left wing swiss more likely to move out of the country because they hate switzerland and what it stands for ?  or are they more likely to move out of the country in order to live in africa or the middle east in the name of "diversity ? " or are they more likely to promote ideals only in as far as when it comes to they own specific countries and promote hypocrisy ?

__label__1 good comment  ,  one could add : marriage to your dog etc  .  .  .  . 
__label__0 well put  ,  i agree  . 
__label__0 now ,  switzerland wants to get involved with this mess !  two men together or two women together cannot reproduce .  if they are gay ,  why are they trying to imitate heterosexual lifestyles ?  .  .  . ridiculous .  more of american brainwashing ! 
__label__0 a presume these "couples" are married ?  ?  ?  marriage exists because some sexual acts between a man and a woman can produce biologically related offspring ,  so where does the state fit into altering biology and thus further rendering a strange definition of couples for the purpose of parenting ?  ?

__label__1 dear sir / madam i am the student of third year of inter-faculty slavonic study at the university of warsaw .  i am seeking an internship for february - july 2013 ,  and while researching opportunities in the field of librarianship ,  i found your institution ,  which i consider as perfect place to broaden my horizons ,  acquire new experience and knowledge .  i am writing to enquire about possible internship opportunities with british library .  during the past three years at university i gained a great theoretical knowledge of philosophy ,  society and culture of europe ,  social history of europe ,  institutions and decision process in the eu ,  civilizations of the east ,  nation and national relations and linguistics .  however ,  the cultural heritage of europe is my great interest and i would like to continue my personal development in that field .  the internship in such amazing ,  historical place would be wonderful opportunity .  i am a very active person .  since i started my high school education i’ve been involved in organizing social and cultural events .  i took part in various contests such as: russian language “olympics” ,  olympic in philosophy and odyssey of the mind .  during my three years of high school i maintained a close cooperation with publishing enterprise wam in cracow working as a book reviewer .  i also helped the school library with organizing matters .  i am currently a member of koło młodych dyplomatów uniwersytetu warszawskiego  ( young diplomats association of university of warsaw )  ,  i organize philosophy meetings and conferences in cooperation with a bookshop tarabuk and the university of warsaw .  last september ,  as a part of a project osvitapol ,  i was working with a group of students from ukraine ,  teaching them polish language and culture .  during my university career i took an internship in the russian centre for culture and science where i was responsible for organizing cultural events .  i attended a russian language course and obtained a certificate of russian in business on a level c1  ( certificate granted by the pushkin state russian language institute in moscow )  .  i obtained also certificate of english on level b2  ( certificate granted by the university of warsaw )  and attended a spanish language course on level b1 .  i attended a computer course and obtained the european computer driving license .  during my three years on the university i also was working .  this experience was very valuable .  i was working in marks & spencer .  it specializes in the selling of clothing and luxury food products .  i also was working in gfk polonia as an interviewer .  i have attended an internship in joker solution company .  my task there was finding eu founds and grants opportunities .  during my internship i was responsible for preparing documents and for customer consulting .  i have gained a confidence in a direct contact with clients and i have developed my communication and business techniques .  i am cheerful book lover ,  who is not afraid new challenges .  i am a hard-working and dutiful .  i would be interested in organizing collections / items in english ,  polish ,  russian and spanish languages about europe and any other subject .  i am reliable ,  diligent and devoted to my work .  i am especially interested in folk art ,  history ,  cinematography which i find very inspiring .  i am also keen on traveling .  getting to know new countries ,  cultures ,  and customs is very precious for me .  i also hope for improving my language skills in the international environment .  i believe ,  that i am a perfect candidate for the internship in your institution .  i would be available to start in february ,  and i would like to finish in july; before my bachelor’s exam .  i hope you will take a favorable decision regarding my candidature .  .  thank you for your consideration .  i ' m looking forward to receiving your reply .  your faithfully nela dębniak

__label__1 swissinfo ,  could you instead of doing free advertisement for unions and left parties more about how switzerland could manage their economy in crisis times ?  or about how swiss companies help abroad ?  most of your information is now highly biased as it shows only one involved party .  most of the information in the article “salaries – the great social and moral divide” is coming from unknown economist ,  socialist parties and unions .  why did not you get information from the kof or seco ?  you also stated that there is no reasons for the salary difference .  yes there is ,  according to chrystia freeland ,  „the rise of the new global super-rich and the fall of everyone else” and “the rich and the rest” vom “the economist” bestätigt .   ( oct 13th 2012 | )  three are the reasons: 1 .  globalization 2 .  the technology revolution 3 .  set of political shifts .  but showing one part of the story is not impartial .  and is even worst when this people don’t even represent more than 25% of the swiss electorate .  kind regards ,  hans bühler

__label__0 it is not totally true that the main or only reason for swiss prices are due to extortion or price-fixing .  other real reasons include a smaller market compared to germany ,  expensive fuel and transport fees  ( trucks )  ,  higher rentals and cost of business here ,  and then the higher salaries of swiss workers .  if you don ' t like swiss prices ,  then you can take a german salary and pay german tax .  no one is stopping you . 
__label__0 this wrong doing is beyond belief .  it appears that little or no sanctions will be taken against those responsible for this fraud .  criminal prosecution must happen and those found guilty should face prison for at least 20 years without any chance of earlier release .  all senior ubs management responsible during these these unfortunate times should face prosecution and be stopped by law from ever working in the banking sector again .  we need to be tough and punish such dishonest and evil wrong doing .  until now these "fat cats" have only risked losing their jobs whilst the rest of us have to pick up the pieces .  action is required now to protect the public .  however ,  i expect those in power will only sit on their hands as they are probably implicated as well .  the public needs to see justice is being done for the first time to prevent these crimes from ever being repeated . 
__label__0 as a matter of curiosity ,  where does all the money collected from fines go ? 
__label__0 it is rather amusing to see that ,  while making fun of these maya prophecies ,  as the so-called  ' doomsday '  approaches so many articles are appearing in the news media .  if it isn ' t more than a myth .  .  . why bother with it ?  just a few more hours and we ' ll see ,  eh ? 
__label__0 any oranisation that cannot get it ' s auditors to  ' sign-off '  it ' s accounts for 20 odd years should be totally ignored . 
__label__0 switzerland has not much to gain and a lot to lose by giving in tio eu bullying .  i ' ve lived here for over 10 years and like most swiss can see the eu spinning out of control .  unelected eurocrats are being exposed as living in a fantasy land .  my plea to switzerland: treasure and respect what makes you so special and let them go hang . 
__label__0 this is the type of thuggery practiced by a country about to crash and become a has been outpost .  you heard it here first .

__label__0 in the u . s .  ,  i suspect the  ' use by '  dates stem from lawsuits ,  some justified ,  some initiated by opportunistic lawyers .  this may be true elsewhere including ch .  this aspect should be considered by all interested parties including the article ' s author . 
__label__0 and not just in switzerland .  .  . how many food items are discarded just because of slight imperfections yet still totally edible .  this is a crime !

__label__0 take it from us ,  when you subsidize something you get more of it .  . 
__label__0 "the christian church soon hijacked the mid-winter custom .  .  . " interesting choice of words .  .  . once could have used "transformed" ,  "appropriated" ,  or even "edified" the mid-winter custom .  but no ,  swissinfo never misses an occasion to portray christians as extremists and slam the church .  at the  ( many christian )  taxpayer ' s expense ,  of course .  .  . 
__label__0 a country that holds a trial for war crimes must be neutral . 
__label__0 unfortunately for some of us ,  the choice is between a lower cost alternative or no holiday at all . 
__label__0 country of origin is very important ,  it lets consumers support various economies and make valid decisions on ethical manufacturing .  i ' m sure many people happily support goods from poverty stricken nations .  living in australia i would not support locally grown rice in such a dry country .  however product from asia would make more sence .  germany is supporting europe at the moment so buying their goods helps many . 
__label__0 i ' m loving this new president ! 
__label__0 true .  when you travel to these countries and ideas of equality is just fantasy talk .  as you vote your true nature by where you live and with your feet ! 
__label__0 so let me understand your logic .  a madman walking into a school with deadly intent carrying chopsticks will have the same outcome as a man carrying a semi-automatic weapon ?  seriously ?  i am all for reasoned debate but .  .  . 
__label__0 one wonders about these anti depressant drugs that are so popular today and whether they are responsible for psychotic behavior . 
__label__0 if there is any lesson to be learned from this and other cases it would be prudent for swiss banks not to do any business with americans ,  including opening subsidiaries in that country .  look to the east ,  rather then across the atlantic .  it would by far be a wiser move . 
__label__1 im australian and the only thing i will ever remember is australia should take a leaf from the swiss book of experience if it can ever get its head out of its arse long enough to see where this book may be ,  get real helen 1 mad man and here we pay them to sit in our parliment ,  excuse me while i choke on my own vomit
__label__0 in switzerland ,  we do not need more guns .  we need the police to react faster and the public to be more aware of the difference between a gunshot and a car-tire  ( autopneu )  blowing up .  only trained armed people should intervene in case of amok gun fights . 
__label__1 this sounds like a fascinating interactive exhibit .  the ratio of the statistics and interest in procedures mentioned in this article are about equivalent to the us ,  but of course there are many more cosmetic surgeons and patients .  and ,  yes ,  breast augmentation is the most popular procedure in the united states .  i found it interesting that photographs are often included with job applications in switzerland ,  much like korea ,  i guess .  dr rhys branman little rock cosmetic surgery center
__label__0 three big problems with the tourism industry in switzerland .  high taxes make it expensive to operate hotels / etc in switzerland ,  which forces up the price of rooms .  could be fixed by government intervention .  high price of the chf vs .  eur and usd .  tough to fix ,  but the government did intervene to attempt a fix by pegging the chf to the eur .  import taxes on food .  this is actually a killer ,  as some other posters have noted ,  food in switzerland is ridiculously expensive .  the import taxes are meant to help growers here ,  but they penalize the tourism industry to a large extend .  it just costs too much to get quality food items in switzerland .  why does a hamburger meal at mcdonald ' s cost 10-12 chf  ( or more )  ?  when its about 1 / 2 that just across the border in germany .  its crazy .  you can see this cost graphically on the big mac index . 
__label__0 one sunday ,  i was so bored in switzerland ,  i walked to france .  this was back in 1985 while i was on a student ' s  ' grand tour '  of europe .  aside from that brief spell of boredom ,  i loved visiting swiss cities  ( didn ' t get out to the countryside on that trip )  .  i think the majority of comments point out the difficulty of certain tourists getting visas and the overall expense of being a  ' tourist '  in switzerland ,  even for swiss deciding to take a weekend break .  economics being what they are ,  the value of the sfr is not going to be changed just for tourists .  however adding and / or expanding the more economical end of swiss hospitality  ( like the excellent youthhostel system )  could  ' dull '  some of the pain of a high sfr .  and i am surprised by comments about swiss hospitality; isn ' t this the country that made running a hotel into a science ?  personally ,  i would return to switzerland as a tourist just to enjoy the wonderful variation of transportation systems that have evolved over the years from the newest generation of steam engines that travel up the sides of mountains to a  ' convertible '  bus that winds its way along mountain roads and through the world-record long tunnels  ( summer time only ,  please )  .  throw in a couple of lake cruises; inexpensive but clean and comfortable accommodation; and i would be there in a flash ! 
__label__0 i honestly don ' t have that experience as far as number 3 is concerned .  queues are well-respected ,  and if you have a decent enough reason and ask nicely ,  people will typically let you ahead .  note that kids that stand around  /  move in different speeds rather than moving with the queue and their parents *do* get ignored .  you can see it as a mix of allowing kids to do this  ( both standing still in a queue and skipping forward are usually okay ,  they might be searching for parents or such )  and everyone not wanting to figure out what exactly is going on and disrupting the queue themselves by doing so .  teach kids to move exactly with the queue ,  and preferably ,  to move with you ,  and you ' ll presumably have no problems . 
__label__0 @miki: "prudent swiss" ?  ?  i would contrarily suggest "pollyanna ignorant swiss" as being a far more accurate appraisal .  therefore all of these continuing ,  innocent as a deer in the headlights ,  "we knew nothing" responses from  ( ignorant ,  pollyanna )  ubs managers .  and this is endemic throughout the organization ,  especially in i . t .  !  !  therefore the "absence of  ( i . t .  )  ontrols" et cetera ,  et cetera ,  et cetera ,  which allows the "self-regulated banks"  ( @sam )  to get into so much trouble  ( such as suddenly discovering undisclosed and unauthorized billion dollar trading losses )  .  ubs management is most certainly *not* asleep !  they are just *all* incredibly stupid and incredulous to their lack of intelligence . 
__label__0 mr .  rohner is spinning the same nonsense that he and the other ubs executives spewed during the ubs tax scandal .  they always claim ignorance and blame those lower level employees for the problems .  they are lying .  what was made very clear during the tax scandal is that the senior executives at ubs - when rohner was there - conducted a whitewash when they blamed it all on a "compliance problem" by lower level employees .  the tax fraud turned out to be part of a very highly coordinated effort by the bank .  some of the most senior ubs executives at that time remain under indictment to this very day .  the ubs executives lied then and rohner is lying now . 
__label__1 as ever ,  gottlieb continuing her bashing of the us when if fact ,  germany has a quasi-fascist leader in merkal .  .  . what ' s that gott ?  i can ' t hear you .  .  . speak up there frau .  .  . 
__label__0 vote with the realisation that you cannot turn a housing development back into a meadow .  if it were only about the  ' real estate '  ,  then switzerland may as well be monaco . 
__label__0 wake up people the fact that a married family paying a higher tax rate because they are married  ?  the govt here are a joke running the place like it ' s 1930 ' s both  , wake up  .  .  !  !  the cost of housing in ch = joke needs govt action the cost of health insurance = joke model broken needs govt the cost of child care = joke 2 people working = more tax the cost of transport = train is a joke 200 chf to take a trip to zh the swiss have money for ubs and co bail outs and snb buying 600 bil in euro etc let ' s invest just a few of those in these problem fixed .  how a party that is for the middle class family first can ' t change policy in bern is beyond me  , stop looking after the big rich fat cats and start looking after the real back bone of the country the people . 
__label__0 so so .  .  .  . and what about the famous swiss post ?  ?  they give their newspaper carriers must less than minimum wage .  .  . sunday wage is chf 17 . 00 per hour !  !  !  !  go figure .  the monopoly who has been stealing from the swiss society for years has such salaries for the people breaking their backs .  .  . go figure ! 
__label__0 sfr22 is way too much for minimum wage ,  even considering the cost of living in ch . 
__label__0 the only reason to have secret bank accounts is if you have something to hide and to avoid paying tax .  if everyone paid the correct amount of tax ,  then those who are open and honest about their money don ' t have to pay more tax to cover those criminals either don ' t pay or don ' t pay enough . 
__label__0 flat tax rate is way too high .  so a client willing to forgo this amount of money rather than risk his / her name being thrown out in open to his / her home country has higher stakes involved in the game than just opting for swiss stability .  .  moreover ,  at some point swiss have to think whom are they defending: their banking business ,  or clients '  issues with their home countries .  in the 1st case ,  the banks should come clean & handover the details of clients .  in the 2nd case ,  swiss are acting as lawyers for these people against their own countries '  tax offices ,  albeit with a hope of getting more business .  this is bound to fail as the flat tax rate is given back to the foreign country and cant be had by swiss banks as commission  ( fees )  to maintain secrecy .  all in all ,  swiss secrecy model is effectively helping only crooks and has nothing to do with success of its banking traditions .  they shouldnt defend it .  every now and then a "once in a lifetime" settlement with another country wipes out all small penny profits made .  its a stupid business model annyway .  like "penny wise ,  pound foolish" types . 
__label__0 paul ,  what alternative to government do you think you have ?  who ' s going to print credible currency  ( i ' ll sell you nothing for a trump dollar or a murdoch pound )  ,  provide rule of law  ( rather than rich men ' s thugs looking for trouble )  ,  or provide any of the infrastructure that even the richest need  ( no drive to the airport ,  however expensive the car ,  because there ' ll be no road and no airport to go to )  without the government you slander as thieves  ( note the spelling )  ?  what ' s made switzerland one of the  ' most liveable and peaceful '  countries in the world is constancy of civil rule .  what can the big private anti-government money offer in return ? 
__label__0 i think until each of you doo -gooders is housing at least two of those poor creatures  ,  you should have no public say .  talk is so cheap . 
__label__0 @vera gottlieb ,  switzerland: the last thing switzerland ' s defense forces are in need of are  ' dope heads '   ( druggies )  and  ' life is good '  losers that are evidently now common in a large population of switzerland .  have we not seen it all over the past 3-4 decades ? 
__label__0 well iam wonderring what about the millions and millions of dollars that are in the swiss banks  ( mubaraks former president )  if they give it back to the egyptians it will be enough . 
__label__0 i agree .  a socio-economic breakdown would certainly provide more useful information for policymakers .  and a whole 60 minutes would make for a luxurious lunchtime ! 
__label__0 can ' t believe left wing organizations want to run the country into the ground .  hopefully these measures against "asylum" will be passed . 
__label__0 this makes no sense .  all weapons violate human rights .  weapons kill people .  and if you believe in the "right to life" then guns by their very nature violate human rights .  then again i believe human rights to be a social construct  ( shown by history )  . 
__label__0 bad news for the people of nyon ,  but not a bad or wrong decision .  the management of kriss should have a plan b . 
__label__0 being  ' clearly fed-up '  is an understatement .  it is still the workers of companies who make profitable gains possible - not the ceo sitting pretty in some air-conditioned luxury office .  would he know how to start the coffee maker ? 
__label__0 with regulation and the financial crisis ,  banks are undeniably suffering .  however ,  it has been made clear that banks are too big to fail .  it is going to take a lot to do this ,  and avoid another crisis if banks keep going down the wrong path ,  but the road to recovery is never easy or short . 
__label__0  ' treason '  ?  problems can ' t be dealt with until they ' ve been identified as problems .  pointing out that a friend has a problem is what shows you as a true friend ,  so speaking about a problem your country has is true patriotism .  or do you simply seek to hide flagwaving and xenophobia under that term ? 
__label__0 while i agree with your depiction of the injustice of singling out switzerland when american and british banks are some of the worst offenders ,  it must be said that banks  ( and the people they employ )  are typically unscrupulous and will accept any money from any source if they think there is a good chance of not being caught .  "i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies .  if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency ,  first by inflation ,  then by deflation ,  the banks and corporations that will grow up around [the banks] will deprive the people of all property until their children wake-up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered .  the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people ,  to whom it properly belongs .  thomas jefferson ,   ( attributed )  3rd president of us  ( 1743 - 1826 ) 
__label__0 this is no surprise to anybody .  switzerland ,  with the active assistance of the swiss government ,  has long been an island of refuge for dirty money and everybody knows it .  the profits are too large to turn away from it which is why the swiss government ,  in concert with the swiss banks ,  have encouraged this over many decades .  the outrage is increased ,  and the hypocracy is clear ,  when we hear the phony cries of shock and surprise when banks are caught involved in these illegal schemes . 
__label__0 this does seem like a very hasty decision - burning one bridge before any other has been built .  that said ,  it does now mean that resources can be channelled into renewables on the basis of need .  in the meantime ,  we ' re still left with the costs of clearing up after  ' cheap '  nuclear energy: where are we going to bury it all ,  anyway ? 
__label__0 whether in switzerland or any other country ,  how much longer are we ,  the public ,  supposed to put up with these  ' merchants of death '  ? 
__label__0 this is ridiculous .  nuclear power represents one of the safest forms of power available and in comparison to other forms of common power production is far less dangerous . 
__label__0 heard today on swiss tv: according to a recent study made by the kof  ( institute for economic studies - university of zurich )  ,  our gdp will shrink by up to 25 per cent and the unemployment rate double if the government ' s green energy plan were to be implemented .  makes us wonder whether our politicians will read this report  ( looked like 100 pages plus )  or simply throw it into the waste basket . 
__label__0 you ' re right .  democracies are always at risk of the tyranny of the majority - which is why a constitutional republic ,  not democracy ,  is the better form of government .  the swiss get off with direct democracy becasue it is decentralized ,  it is slow ,  and the people generally respect the law of the land .  i think bringing  ' rights '  into the discussion is confusing .  a referendum is valid if and only if its language and its procedure conform to the law of the land .  though morality or rights or emotions will affect how we vote in a referendum ,  these ideas have no place in determining whether the referendum is valid - only the law can determine that . 
__label__0 firstly ,  yes ,  i do want the community to vote on whether someone deserves medical treatment if i am paying it and that person was warned throughout his life that smoking kills .  it ' s called individual responsibility .  ,  secondly ,  someone has to *always* make a decision - either way it involves some form of aggregation device .  thirdly ,  if you do not want a crowd to decide such a decision ,  walk with your feet and move to another canton !  fourthly ,  all immigrants receive fair and equal protection before the law: they all have to have their citizenship put to a vote .  finally ,  what you call a "mob" is really this: the status quo .  it imposes a check and balance because it says no to deviating from the status quo .  in any event ,  in a world of externalities one man ' s wilful punishment is another man ' s liberation .  all this research proves is swiss voters i )  have high standards; ii )  are discerning .  in fact ,   ' screening applicants at the local level is perfect because who knows the applicant better than those the candidate live around ?  they get to see the person day in and day out .  they see how they behave ,  their ethics '  . 
__label__0 switzerland does not have a "socialist" health care system .  so what are you going on about ? 
__label__0 milton friedman and others demonstrated that lowering taxes is always the best option for the growth of a country .  but remember that some years ago a nice guy called galileo invented the scientific principle ,  so let ' s use it: just try the theory for some years and see if the wealth of the people will be better after lowering taxes and attracting investors or not .  parameters such the unemployment and average salary are easy to measure .  so as galileo said ,  apply the theory ,  verify the results and decide .  it ' s very easy .  .  .  and i ' m ready to bet that lowering the taxes will demonstrate to be a positive choice !  politics ,  like any science ,  is easy to test .  .  .  : ) 
__label__0 the problem with this statement is that it completely ignores several factors in firearm regulation and firearm-related crime .  the claim that firearms would simply disappear from the hands of criminals if prohibited can swiftly be rendered invalid by the mention of drug prohibition .  in many countries ,  marijuana ,  heroin ,  meth-amphetamine and other strong drugs are completely prohibited ,  yet the people who want them still have them .  furthermore ,  the prohibition of drugs has sparked a billion-dollar black market full of drugs that are not accounted for or regulated ,  and the very same thing is likely to happen in the case of firearms ,  should they be completely outlawed .  in that case ,  i ' d take a million guns that are registered over 750k guns that aren ' t .  it all boils down to the fact that criminals will have firearms regardless of the law .  britain is often used as a shining example of gun-control ,  yet british police confiscate illegal weapons by the ton each month .  another blatant flaw in the gun-control mentality is the firearms  ' monopoly '  on murder .  you ' re right in the sense that not having a firearm means you cannot kill someone with a -firearm- ,  but there is still an immense number of ways to take a life that do -not- include firearms .  ultimately ,  gun-control -does- lower the firearm-related crimes and murders ,  the real problem is that it does not lower the overall crimes and murders .  it ' s a moot point ,  because it has no legitimate impact on murder and crime .  just my two cents . 
__label__1 i agree !  as a gay man ,  i would *never* want some woman attempting to "teach" a male child about what will pleasure his penis !  imagine the horror ! 
__label__0 i don ' t see why this isn ' t allowed .  i hope our parliament makes it possible for homosexual couples to adopt children .  as far as i ' m concerned ,  we could even make those rare polygamous relationships legal parents to a child  ( more than 2 parents )  .  all that matters ,  ultimately ,  is that the child is well cared for and loved .

__label__1 dear ms .  von matt ,  i would be keen to read an interview of fredy müller ,  head of the lobbyists '  organization in bern  ( or of anyone who has held that office )  .  what ' s of interest is their take on how things are different for lobbyists in switzerland versus other countries .  in my country ,  lobbyists arguably have more say in governance than does the public -- but ours is not the beacon of democracy that switzerland is .  sincerely ,  david torney
__label__0 start with the founding of the confederation and look within the swiss borders .  plenty of atrocities from then through to the 21st century .  my swiss ancestors were among the victims .  that is why i was born an american .  if they had not been subject to swiss atrocities ,  they would have remained in switzerland and not emigrated to america to commit atrocities on the indians .  wauwilermoos was an atrocity and a war crime .  by the way ,  if nazi germany had not been so occupied with fending off the russian and american military they would have taken switzerland .  it certainly had laid out the strategies and had the means to do it .  i stand by my original statement .  i agree with you that special interest groups are wrong in trying to profit from some perceived atocity real or not .  the politicians that put on the  ' muscle '  to get the reparations are the beneficiaries . 
__label__0 it would be beneficial to encourage greater ownership of the primary residence ,  why i ' m not sure but i ' m sure it would be and i ' m sure the swiss government can do this thing ,  home is where the heart is ,  home sweet home  .  .  .  .  . 
__label__0 what is your idea about sinhalese &amp; muslims , kicked out from north &amp; east by tamil tigers since 1983 . these poeple also have the right to go &amp; stay in their lands . any tamil has the right &amp; protection to stay in any place in sri lanka . so why not to sinhalese &amp; muslims . all the political parties are playing a game to collect tamil votes . so the betray other nations . 
__label__0 i applaud dr .  kumar david’d analysis that are quite in place .  most said in this write-up have been my gut feelings that i have been mentioning in my comments from time to time .  in my opinion ,  india is misreading all the signals emitted from within the region and have been easily cajoled by the americans to be sleeping with them in order to use india as a tool to stress usa’s presence in south asia .  usa has lost its confidence on onetime ally pakistan for which usa invested a whole lot of money as it did with egypt for many decades .  in the recent past india was badly mislead by the former secretary of state of usa .  supposedly the strategy has been to pit sri lanka against india in order to have china that is a close ally of sri lanka dragged in to open dialogue on its dealings with sri lanka .  the west is doing its best to squeeze sri lanka through the manipulation of the unhcr related to purported war crimes that had occurred during its war against world’s notorious terrorist in 2009 .  the general consensus of the right thinking world is that the west is trying to hurt sri lanka not because of so called excesses of the war but to break sri lanka’s bond with china and russia –two important veto powers in the un security council .  furthermore ,  the very u . s .  secretary of state made a so called unofficial visit to tamil nadu to meet chief minister jayalalitha is highly speculated to have been in connection to 2012 unhcr review on sri lanka to have tamil nadu apply pressure on govt .  of india to act against sri lanak .  in summing up all these activities ,  it is apparent that india is trotting about with cross worn shoes .  india needs astute people handling its foreign policy . 
__label__0 they would be better served to take the money and go to las vegas with it !  these olympic bids are scandalous as so much money disappears into the pockets of those promoting the games .  often bids are put forward when success is minimal ,  at best .  olympic games are a relic of the past .  too much money spent on professional athletes .

__label__0 the fact that you are unaware of the dangers of eating horsemeat perfectly illustrates the deception that is being practiced on the consumers of horse meat ,  let alone those who are getting horsemeat when they think it is beef .  horses are not raised for food in north america .  you are eating ex race ,  sport and family pets .  all of which receive numerous drugs banned from entering the human food chain .  the only protection offered the consumer is a form that allows kill buyers to sign off in bulk all the horses they present to the slaughter house in one day to sign a sentence that says" to the best of my knowledge" since kill buyers get most of the horses at auctions ,  and own them for as little time possible ,  they have no idea what drugs these horses have been given ,  and they don ' t care !  30-40% of the horses sent to slaughter are race horses who anyone knows are given many performance enhancing drugs !  yet the canadian government turns a blind eye .  remember when the tobacco industry claimed cigarettes do not cause cancer ?

__label__0 we from mactyre won ' t allow switzerland to introduce wild life into their lands ,  just to see whether they are able to live along human beings .  humans can not live along wild life ,  and therefor a wild creature should be killed ?  why take their food source away by hunters and ask yourself why they are seeking for food ,  and interfere with humans .  when a bear is hungry ,  then it isn ' t afraid of anything ,  and it wouldn ' t avoid human beings as a possible food source .  if you introduce wild life into your country ,  then you should give them the possibility to feed themselves and hunt ! 
__label__0 agreed .  there appear to have been many options taken by the authorities ,  but ,  instead of using human initiative ,  understanding and compassion for another living creature they chose "the policy" put in place and followed a  ' procedure '  .  the world is becoming a sadder and sadder place is it not ,  with so many in decision making capacities disconnecting from their hearts and becoming more and more like the computers they sit in front of .  m13 had a right to exist too .  imagine the future world with no living creatures other than the human !  we can ' t get on with each other now .  what will that world look like .  a good example emerged this week . 
__label__0 wild europeans ! 
__label__0 unfortunately by now ,  the  ' homo sapiens '  should recognize ,  more so acknowledge that they are the most dangerous  ' animal '  on this once good old planet earth .  what other species ,  other than the homo sapiens are more dangerous ? 
__label__0 shot by a swiss official to protect local residents as the bear was becoming a danger and held no fear for humans .  it was a case of prevention ,  because if a serious incident had occurred ,  then everyone would have been asking why nothing was done .  you cannot easily move a bear as their territory is so large; this one covered switzerland ,  italy and austria  ( it originated from italy ,  where its family group still are )  so was never a "swiss" bear to begin with . 
__label__1 80% of americans do not want horses slaughtered .  our state and federal legislators have been educated on this until we are blue in the face .  it is shameful that we in the us have had to go around our own govt by appealing to the countries who buy the tainted horse meat .  we in the us thank you switzerland for having the ethics that our own government does not have .  it is criminal that our government is aware of the banned drugs in horses but still knowingly keeps the trade alive .  our government has been conspiratorial in poisoning europeans for decades and lying about it . 
__label__0 as a horse owner i have known about the abuses for many years .  i am glad that the suffering of these animals is now being shown in the countries that do purchase the products .  it has never been humane will never be humane ,  and as a horse owner i will continue to make my animals comfortable by using drugs that have been banned in the food chain .  horses in north america are privately owned and they will be given drugs until they are no longer usable ,  so the drug issue will never leave it will always be in the product .  until the consumers who are buying these products understand that here in the us the animals are not owned by the people who sell them to the slaughter plants for longer than a week ,  the passport system will not be a viable means of protecting the products .  these animals are not held in feedlots for 6 months ,  they are shipped immediately from auctions to slaughter .  your food chain will never be safe if you are eating horsemeat from mexico or canada .  thank you for spreading the word . 
__label__0 rehabilitation can work but not in a prison structure like us .  people are thrown into prisons for nothing and with extremely violent criminals at that .  sure ,  some prisoners need to stay locked up but there is nothing wrong with trying rehabilitation in a humane way .  people can change . 
__label__1 you can leave anytime you like .  the rest of us swiss voted clearly on the issue .  if you cannot accept the outcome of a democratic process you shouldn ' t be here: europe is big ,  there are plenty of gun-free places you can take your shrill self .  ; )  better control on markedly disturbed people should be stepped up .  maybe it will include you .  ; ) 
__label__0 ignorance of and about the state of the day to day affairs and crime activities against the citizens ,  innocent foreign population and businesses in switzerland has also some questionable meaning and hidden purpose .  by now ,  some unknown and suspected extremely high number of illegal unregistered guns are now in possession of recent  ( legal and illegal )  immigrants and the ,  by now so labeled  ' criminal tourists '  that ,  since the open border policy took effect ,  have been infiltrating switzerland as their evidently easy "business" target .  with the now virtually disabled border guards and the by now understaffed  ' home security '  police forces being increasingly overwhelmed ,  how does anyone expect the swiss to defend themselves ,  now or in the future ?  by throwing rocks or cheese at the attackers ? 
__label__0 stan .  .  . you hit it on the nose !  us creates "parallel societies" with each little group having their own rights ,  switzerland has managed to avoid that .  the government "listens" to the people in switzerland so there is less antagonism against the government .  you are correct .  .  . the us will not get rid of guns the people have been to brainwashed .  it ' s a pity because commonsense in the us is not so common anymore .  more guns does not equate to more safety !  thanks for being honest .  .  . 
__label__0 @lynx .  .  . the "ban automobiles" argument is getting tired .  people don ' t go out and "intentionally" use a car as a weapon to kill others ,  they do with guns !  simple really .  .  . however ,  i agree that people must "speak up" when they notice someone with extreme mental problems in public .  the shooter ' s mental condition was obvious . 
__label__0 switzerland is an "intelligently run society" ,  thank you very much .  firearms are part of that society . 
__label__0 congratulations to the red cross museum for doing the right thing ,  and helping maintain the long tradition of high ethical standards of the red cross movement .  this is not just a matter of stiff principles ,  either: tobacco leaves an odor on money just like it does on everything else .  for every $6000 of profit earned another person dies .  .  .  . most often in low- and middle-income countries .  money of sponsorships to good causes ,  art ,  music .  .  .  . it buys influence ,  it buys allegiance ,  it buys image ,  it stifles support for the simple policies and actions that protect lives and health .  .  .  . and not coincidentally ,  hurt business .

__label__0 i studied at your hotel school in lausanne and i paid twice the fees the swiss students paid and with a rapidly declining australian dollar back in the mid 70 ' s .  also i was funding this myself with no assistance from my own country and i paid full fares on publice transport etc .  .  .  so i don ' t think switzerland was generous to me .  however generally i made the most of my time in europe and have returned on holidays a no .  of times . 
__label__0 switzerland is attractive for students: quality of life is very good as well as the quality of education  ( with good reputation )  .  several languages are spoken in switzerland which constitute an asset for students willing to work worldwide .  concerning my personal experience ,  i quit my university in france after i suffered 3 blockades in 3 years .  i expected public universities in switzerland to be less troubled .  finally i do not think foreign students should pay more: students mobility is a good way to build good relations between countries .  and it is already difficult financially to study in switzerland ,  more for foreigners than for locals .  increasing fees would only make integration more difficult .  regards , 
__label__0 i studied medicine at the university of basel from 1960 (  including undergraduate courses )  to 1970 .  i lived in basel for ten years and thoroughly enjoyed my experience .  i am also a member of the university of basel medical alumni association .  the swiss were really great to me . 
__label__0 i spent 5 years studying in ch  ( 3 in lugano @usi and 2 at hec lausanne )  .  i think the quality of the swiss university is really good and professors are usually spured to have good and smart relationships with the students  ( that is to say ,  incentive research debates comments and so on )  .  moreover the international environment is a great plus .  the biggest issue is that ch university is very job-oriented  ( at least in economics )  and makes very diffucult for students to start a phd abroad after ,  if the phd is not a pure quantitative one .  about the taxes: no ,  should not increase .  it is true that now are lower even compared to the italian ones  ( a master in italy costs around 2000€ / year - 2500chf / year )  but the cost of living is amazing high ,  for germans as well !  so ,  with higher taxes ch would lose a lot of smart brains and / orwould staedly incentive non-regular house contracts or other bad practices .  thank you for your job ,  a very useful one .  i hope you found my lines interesting .  best ,  alessandro n . 
__label__0 i attended the eti  ( ecole de traduction et d ' interprétation )  from 1979 through 1984 .  although i loved studying and living in geneva  ( i even have now a house in crans montana )  ,  the truth is that i was very disappointed about my "university" experience .  the eti was ,  at that time ,  everything except a conventional university !  main courses were held in their own building ,  which looked more like an office building than like a university .  only two courses ,  economy and law ,  were  ( happily !  )  held at the university premises located in uni bastions .  .  .  those were the only times i felt i was a university student !  however ,  eti was a great school with an amazing reputation worldwide .  cristina limido

__label__0 you may want to read again the cv of rené joyeuse .  had he not been a swiss citizen ,  he would not have been allowed to serve in the swiss army .  he was awarded the french honorary legion distinction for services rendered to the nation but is unconnected to the foreign legion .  being of above-average intelligence and multilingual made him a valuable "asset" for the allied intelligence services .  by the way ,  having seen documentary films on the training camps of the french foreign legion you can easily imagine that those who survived must have been really tough guys .  the swiss who served in the legion breached a constitutional law and were sentenced to jail if they came back .  however ,  in comparison with their army experience that must have been like a mere holiday camp .  .  . 
__label__0 those that have children rarely care about the impact on those who want a peaceful life - at home ,  in restaurants ,  on public transport .  perhaps it ' s time to set up housing zones - an specific area for those with children ,  single people  ( separate areas for gay ,  lesbian ,  straight )  ,  old people ,  etc .  then those areas can offer services that best meet the needs of each group of people e . g .  playgrounds for kids ,  more clubs and bars for singles ,  more nursing homes for the elderly .  once your circumstances change ,  you have to move to the right area .

__label__1 it lacks independence and it is dictated by western powers and other group of lobbying .  the money that was wasted in it judgments should be used to meet the needs of survivors of the genocide of tutsi .  in other words ,  international justice does not exist; this court is a ghost that has been set up to distract those who do not have eyes to see and ears to hear . 
__label__1 greetings ,  i am very glad to hear and join this discussion team .  as journalist ,  i found this penal discussion as a very open door to the truth of the chapter of1994 in our country ,  a lot mass crimes still under the desk but remember that in justice all sin  ( even steeling things ,  gacaca is my witness )  are the same ,  any little or bigger .  fortunately ,  the question of introduction paragraph was and is till now my worry .  why the pretended international tribunal court is only judging one side of the battle field ,  even the former government of rwanda is responsible of the genocide but those who lost their relatives before ,  in and after the genocide will they keep silence ?  i suggest to go in north and western province ,  you will find people telling you that the war in rwanda took 7 years ( 1990-1997 or 8 )  .  diferen people that i meant had different thoughts than what ictr is based .  the young generation is living with ictr ( only genocide ?  ?  ?  ?  )  mindset while they hear lawyer accusing some country officials being accused .  what can you tell to your fellow young brother or sister who may have the above dilemma .  anyway we believe that suiss foreign office is confidential in such document for people like us living inside the country .

__label__0 it ' s certainly true that ,  given the huge inequalities in the world today ,  we might cheer the decision of the indian court to create access to these drugs .  millions of people in africa have benefited from the generic drugs which would otherwise have been unavailable to them .  but however critical we may be of novartis ' s profit-driven attitude ,  we also have to accept that ,  without a reasonable prospect of return on investment ,  these drugs would never have been created in the first place .  this case simply illuminates a much wider problem: the pharmaceutical industry invests far more in alleviating the health problems of the affluent than curing the life-threatening diseases of the poor .  chronically ill rich people are commercially attractive ,  while critically ill poor are not .  that said ,  if there ' s no return on investment ,  why should novartis or their competitors care ?  it exists to provide profit to shareholders ,  a category which indirectly includes most people with a pension scheme .  until novartis can see a payoff in dealing effectively with ,  say ,  malaria  ( rather than simply its effects )  ,  it simply has no reason to expect a return on investment .  we mightn ' t like it ,  but we ' re foolish if we expect it to behave against its own interests - which are actually ours ,  if we ' re not afraid to look .  so what are the alternatives ?  here are two .  1 .  nationalise novartis ,  other pharmaceutical companies ,  and while we ' re at it ,  all other companies funding research: kiss goodbye to your pension .  2 .  pay them to fund specific research into poor people ' s diseases .  since we ' re doing the funding here ,  that is ipso facto not us: say hello to higher taxes  ( much higher ,  once the lobbyists get to work )  with no benefit to us .  oh dear .

__label__1 this is a similar topic in the us as our schools seek out international students ,  while at the same time having to decide if they should raise tuition costs for these students that number 750 , 000 each year .  an interesting new book / ebook that helps them once they are here is "what foreigners need to know about america from a to z: how to understand crazy american culture ,  people ,  government ,  business ,  language and more . ” it paints a revealing picture of america for those who will benefit from a better understanding ,  including international students .  endorsed worldwide by ambassadors ,  educators ,  and editors ,  it also identifies “foreigners” who became successful in the us and how they contributed to our society ,  including students .  a chapter on education explains how to be accepted to an american university and cope with such things as a new culture ,  friendship process and classroom differences they will encounter .  some foreign students stay here after graduation .  it has chapters that explain how us businesses operate and how to get a job ,  a must for those who want to work for an american firm or with a foreign firm in the us environment .  it also has chapters that identify the most common english grammar and speech problems foreigners have and tips for easily overcoming them ,  the number one stumbling block they say they have to succeeding here .  most struggle in their efforts and need guidance from schools’ international departments ,  immigration protection ,  concerned neighbors ,  and books like this to extend a cultural helping hand so we all have a win-win situation .  good luck to all ,  be they in switzerland or the us !  www . americaatoz . com

__label__0 @drb: what good and contribution has the h1-b visa achieved and done to the good old usa ?  as far as i ' ve heard and read ,  nothing at all except undermining the established working american ,  once prosperous middle-class there ,  taking advantage of the social and medical benefits system for you and your extended family in most cases .  the flood gates have been opened for more than just opportunists ,  not just in switzerland but according to some sources also in the usa .  by the way ,  the now so highly touted and still very high-gain profiteering software corporations behind these h1-b visa scams in the usa might be just the final demise of the us economy in the future .  the economic growth driven expansion will ultimately come to a screeching halt and then what ?  the "dot . com" ,  solar panel disaster and the increasingly semiconductor industry decline certainly ought to make some statement .  switzerland ' s ,  as well as the us ' s ,  population certainly were better off before the flood gates were opened up for the benefits of the billionaires making conglomerates . 
__label__0 nothing against immigration into switzerland ,  but highly selective and on strict contingency procedures ,  based on qualifications ,  professional experience ,  working knowledge of italian ,  french or the german language including by any relative wishing to join and live in switzerland ,  awareness of the swiss secular way of life ,  history ,  traditions and its constitutional democracy  .  employers then to be solely responsible to bear all costs of social security / benefits in the event of business failures ,  closures or moving abroad .  what are at stake are the identity of swiss regions and the safeguard of switzerland low and middle income households .  the burden to the swiss taxpayer caused by immigration and asylum is just unsustainable like in the uk integration ,  multiculturalism is on the surface only and seemingly works for those politicians and liberal intellectuals who are after preserving their own credibility .  here also are english speaking doctors needed but not middle eastern baristas .  the uk has lost its identity a long time ago ,  infact since the 60th ,  when industry needed manual work force in the textile and carpet industries from its former colonies .  50 years later this country no longer has a manufacturing base ,  every thing has gone to japan ,  korea ,  china ,  india and pakistan and what is left are financial services benefiting oligarchs ,  arab princes and greedy bankers .

__label__0 the use of the word "slave" in the title of this article is factually incorrect ,  and provocative .  for me it indicates a total lack of journalistic objectivity .  i have no knowledge about this situation beyond what i read in this article ,  so i might be wrong ,  but i suppose that for the most part the people who sent these children to foster parents and elsewhere were good people who were trying to do the right thing .  yes ,  over time the definition of the “right thing” has changed .  and i agree with those changes .  but it’s just a cheap ,  self-gratifying thrill to dump on those people .  compare for example what is happening to children right now in eastern congo and parts of the muslim world .  i have never understood "compensation" .  money will not change the past .  it’s just irrelevant .  to me this is like the situation in the us .  you fall down in wal-mart and break your leg ,  some go to a lawyer ,  who says ,  “jackpot !  5 million dollars compensation ! ” i go to a doctor instead .  ultimately compensation money in this case would come from some poor taxpayer who had nothing whatsoever to do with this issue .  maybe those tax dollars could be better spent .  instead of hyperventilating about wrongs from the past ,  which cannot be undone ,  i suggest readers try to find a way to prevent the wrongs of the present and the future .  they will find that this is hard and get a better sense of the difficult choices people were confronted with in the past .

__label__0 my opinion .  get rid of that type of ideas .  minimum wages is more unemployment and socialism .  work has a price .  if you ask more than what employers are willing to pay you will be living at the others expenses in a no work environment .  so ,  is much better work for less than doing nothing ,  waiting for charity of others .  most of minimum wages countries are passing for that kind of problem .  or they work in an illegal way receiving less money and sucking from the social security money because the officials do not have data about them and take in consideration that they are unemployed .

__label__0 you need not "wonder" any longer .  . just look at what is happening in the u . s with illegal immigrants sneaking over the border constantly .  the swiss have france ,  germany and italian borders where this could happen .  the result would be a stain on the economy .  . jobs ,  housing ,  crime all to be considered .  then the "native" peoples would suffer .  a "reasonable" solution must be reached by reasonable people .

__label__0 when the us starts cleaning up their own house then they will finally get somewhere .  switzerland will come out on top of this situation because they are more patient and intelligent .  us wants everything quick and fast ,  missing all the important factors .  .  . 
__label__0 i agree with you .  the comments on this page are horrendously arrogant .  whoever this steck is ,  maybe he has a reputation .  .  . but the sherpas as a community have been having a fabulous reputation for generations .  these westerners come to india / nepal -- and they think they are kings ,  they can bulldoze -- heaven knows this nutcase behaved to cheese off the sherpas .  and all that bs about hillary guy climibing everest first ,  let me add that if a sherpa did climb it ,  he would not document and tom tom to the whole world what he did .  their humility is beyond your comprehension .  if the sherpas bother you ,  stick to your alps and rockies -- stay away from them .  they don ' t need you or your money .  gosh !  !  !

__label__0 the only people who are impacted by these rules are the rich foreigners who are buying up holiday homes in this alpen paradise .  do we have pity for them ?  i am guessing not . 
__label__1 as a specialist in international finance ,  my question is ,   '  ' is this tax evasion or invasion of privacy ?  '  '  everybody knows that swiss banks collect some 34% of all revenues accrued on its accounts ,  foreign or not .  if an account holder shows proof that he has paid his taxes ,  which almost all do ,  the withheld amount is credited to their account .  if an american ,  german ,  or frenchman were not to declare the income abroad at home ,  about half of the 34% is transferred in an annual lump sum payment to the us income tax authorities  ( depending on the rate foreseen in the double taxation agreement )  .  the obama government  ( watch out for that awful control freek and hater of americans ,  sen .  levin of chicago--a modern-day kaganovitch if ever there was one !  )  now wants americans who make their money abroad to be fully taxed in the country where they make their money and fully taxed in the usa as well .  have these people never heard of the boston tea party ,  which was over the massive overtaxation of americans ?  no taxation without representation !  was the slogan then .  today ,  many americans ,  particularly american mothers who have to sacrifice their sons and daughters for wars they do not win and do not want---wars that they often feel are fought for others rather than for the good of america and over which they have no say at all ,  feel they do not want to contribute their taxes as long as they have no direct say in the matter .  an often bought vote for political office buys some rich guy ' s right to govern them---not the free will of the people ,  and once it is done ,  americans have no say in whatever perversion these  '  ' elected '  '  people impose on them ( the mayor of new york spent over $52 million of his own ill-gotten money to buy his election over the next candidate who had only about $2 million ,  and there are no remedies available to americans to stop that strangling corruption of democracy everywhere )  .  is it any wonder that they don ' t want to contribute to such corruption ?  leave americans ,  germans ,  frenchmen and others the freedom to invest their money where they want to .  by all means ,  pay the taxes ,  but don ' t allow the obama government to rob americans blind ,  to stifle american initative and to strangle its economy by holding them up like criminals .  let americans be free and great .  don ' t negotiate what is wrong: one big nation ' s government forced interference in another free ,  democratic ,  sovereign and efficient country .  of course ,  you can blackmail switzerland into complying with germany ' s america ' s and france ' s immoral and undemocratic invasion of their citizens '  privacy and practices  ( germany even encourages theft of bank records and the use of stolen goods is evidently welcome in their courts---so why should i not steal a couple of mercedes cars because they are useful to me ?  the government of germany does it and has lost all moral justification to stop its citizens from thieving in very store they enter .  what ' s good for the german government ,  surely is good for the germans .  my wish is that switzerland let the banks be banks and that the heavy hand of government should not try to run banks or any other businesses .  it ' s hard enough for private business in the west to compete with the communist businesses in the east without having their hands and legs tied ,  too .  we all know where the heavy hand of dictatorship of a government leads: to guerilla warfare . 
__label__0 the tightened asylum laws are welcome .  contrary to what manon schick thinks ,  switzerland is simply protecting her best interests .  legitimate asylum seekers still have a fair chance to get accepted . 
__label__0 li ' s claims of promotion of human rights and implementation of rule of law is just another lie .  if that is so ,  why is mongolians ,  tibetans ,  ughurs and chinese too get jailed just for daring to ask the basic rights .  rule of law is laughable .  there has never been a one case where justice system passes judgement uninfluenced by party apparatus .  it is all party control .  the constitution and nation itself is subservient to communist party .  the party is the supreme-mantra for the day . 
__label__0 i don ' t think that saying the truth about switzerland is a bad promotion .  the right win in switzerland profit from the refugees and emigrants to hide real problems in switzerland .  are some suisse criminals ?  yes ,  they are; however ,  the news only focus on showing when a foreigner does something bad .  i understand that criminality in switzerland is done with class because it is through the banks .  we take the money and we do not care from whom or where is coming .  i believe that swissinfo is appealing to a reflexion on how emigrants have been treated through history there .  it is a pity to see that the only discourse in politic from the conservatives in switzerland is about immigrants .  they do not care about the cost of living and a group of suisse that cannot survive with the smic and all the taxes .  i always wonder if suisse people believe that the immigrants make the economic politics and if the impact of immigrants is so negative for the whole suisse economic . 
__label__0 globalism fears nationalism as an existential threat .  the fact is that human beings are a tribal species and there are distinct evolutionary reasons for this .  sitting at the crossroads of europe ,  with 800 years of peaceful non-aggression and europe ' s first truly multi-lingual ,  multi-cultural society ,  switzerland has absolutely nothing to apologize for !  it is a simple fact that no society can retain its essential character if the doors are flung open to immigration from the entire world ,  much less a country as small and geographically crowded as ch .  those who posit the need for an authoritarian global government know these facts very well ,  and that is why ,  under the guise of  ' compassion '  and loving kindness they villify all who oppose their outwardly utopian ideas of unrestricted immigration .  exhibit 1 is the usa ,  which has become a prisoner of its pro-immigration rhetoric . 
__label__0 that has to be the craziest thing i ' ve ever heard .  my parents are swiss and i grew up there before willingly moving away .  swiss people constantly save up for a rainy day and complain they don ' t have enough money when they can put away 25% of their income .

__label__0 switzwerland is one of the last paradises countries left .  do u aver ask yourself why ?  ?  because the banks are full of money to reinvest locally and create jobs .  .  .  if you really want to lose all your life quality ,  let that money run somewhere else ,  into taxes or offshore countries .  .  .  this bully country is such a tiranny .  .  .  viva svp ! 
__label__0 collecting and transacting  ( buying and selling )  this array of war kimonos from a japanese era ,  is at most in bad taste and insensitivity to all the asian people killed during ww2 .  there is nothing curious or collectible about war motifs on a japanese kimono .  ask any sensitive japanese person and they will ask you to keep the kimono out of sight . 
__label__0 as with most countries with their own army and soldiers ,  people live in a imaginative oyster shell ,  thinking that their military spending and capability will withstand any or most assaults on their land .  switzerland has a young and small and also combat-inexperienced army .  when a critical and warring situation really happens ,  only then can we really be sure if the preparation was really enough or sufficient .  no man is an island .  switzerland must forge more alliance with other countries in terms of military cooperation and hold more military exercises .  in the past ,  only the mountains and difficult terrains deterred would be conquerors .

__label__0 the problem is not that child care is not profitable .  the problem is that child care is being discussed as an industry ,  a service provided in a market economy .  all things ,  including sexuality and fundamental human rights ,  can become discussed as if they are just services provided in a market economy .  hence prostitution ,  and slavery ,  where such things as sexuality and freedom are bought and sold like objects .  if we choose to discuss child care as a business ,  we should be clear that we are objectifying our children ,  and reducing their welfare to a thing that can be bought and sold .  in my own view ,  the values of parents who speak of children as commodities in their collection of material goods are highly suspect .  perhaps such parents are treated the same way by their corporate masters ? 
__label__0 i am a swiss national and expect a watch to last more than ten years .  two years ago i bought a mondain watch on a visit to switzerland .  it broke down two times on mechanical matters .  it is now in the garbage .  so i support stronger criteria for swiss quality .

__label__0 no taxes are needed for a basic income .  just one programming rule in banking applications ,  to create life entrance money for every person .  this can be done within one day ,  worldwide ,  and costs nothing .  and with every transaction you let resolve a little percentage again .  the percentage is for every transaction the same .  costs nothing .  most of the structures and taxes will disappear by themselves then .  rich people who are rich on their on force ,  will stay rich .  people who are rich because of  ' the system '  ,  will lose there artificial created richness when life is in her own context again .  o it is not about getting taxing money from the rich .  it is about bringing life in her own context again: a human race with her own life entrance back again . 
__label__0 i am a u . s .  citizen ,  however i do not support the u . s .  government going around the world “dictating ,  threatening ,  and condemning” other countries to either comply with the u . s .  demands or face sanctions ,  law suits ,  and other punishments for not doing what the u . s .  government dictates they do .  if another country try’s to dictate policy to the u . s .  government ,  the u . s .  will take actions as if that country is trying to declare war on the u . s .  and yet the u . s .  government sees nothing wrong with threatening another country with war if they do not comply with u . s .  demands .  i’m not alone in voicing my concern ,  in fact ,  most of the people i know feel the same way and we voice our concerns to the government with meetings with senators ,  congress persons ,  write letters ,  emails ,  and make phone calls which seems to fall on “deaf ears &amp; blind eyes , ” because our concerns don’t ever show up anywhere in the media .  i feel that whoever is making the decisions and making policy in the u . s .  government either knows or doesn’t know of my concerns ,  but regardless moves ahead with their plans as if i don’t exist ,  because the “shot callers” in the u . s .  government are insensible to the feelings and concerns of “the people”  ( u . s .  citizen’s )  and move ahead with their bias agenda to do whatever they want having the wealthiest and most powerful people who support the secret agenda of the u . s .  government .  elections may change some players names ,  but these elected officials are only pawns in this chess game and don’t posses any real power .  the pawns role in the game is to “protect” the king ,  queen ,  rooks ,  bishops ,  and knights and pawns are really nameless ,  faceless ,  people who possess no real “power” of their own and are as disposable as a paper napkin .  in present day america the average citizen who is not employed by any u . s .  government department is considered completely “disposable” by the u . s .  government and can be set up to take the “fall” or “blame” for any incident that takes place in which the government needs a “patsy” for .  the rooks ,  bishops ,  and knights represent the wealthiest and most powerful people behind the u . s .  government’s agenda and the king is the president and the queen is the vice president .  unfortunately this game that’s being played is for real and each chess piece represents a real living ,  breathing ,  human being and in this game people can and do get killed and when a human being’s life is taken ,  it doesn’t get any more serious than that .  right now it appears that most of the american citizen’s are sleep walking and unaware of what is really going on around them and i feel that it’s going to take something quite moving to shake them out of their deep slumber and it’s going to have to happen on an individual basis where each person becomes “conscious” of their life and knows who they truly are .  on this basis people can operate on the same level of understanding and great change is possible on a grand scale . 
__label__0 this rejection of my government ' s heavy-handed and hypocritical demand for one-way  ' transparency '  is a good thing .  mr .  blickenstorfer: when you say that americans are "tough but fair" you are assuming the posture of a child toward stern mommy and daddy .  even if ch was the size of vatican city ,  in the field of diplomacy both countries are equals .  the usa has entrenched elite interests that are now grotesque in their double standards .  exhibit 1 is none other than mr .  jack lew ,  with his cayman islands account  ( revealed on the public record during congressional hearings )  solely for the purpose of tax evasion / avoidance .  but i guess this is ok for the secretary of the treasury .  i would guess most american account holders are of 2 varieties: 1 )  american expats who haven ' t gotten around to handing in their passports and 2 )  american professionals  , such as doctors and dentists ,  who opened these accounts as part of a strategy of tax minimization ,  as marketed by international banks such as ubs . 
__label__0 the usa irs will get what it wants and the swiss government will either give it to them or they will start to destroy the swiss banks one by one until they scream and capitulate .  now it is only a matter of how to give the usa bully what it wants and still save face to the swiss people .  the swiss will eventually give up and give in .  they never have the courage to stand up to anything threating  !  !  !

__label__0 i do not believe this nonsense about climate change .  for a start ,  we can ' t stop it from happening ,  it ' s natural .  what do farmers with big greenhouses do ,  to get a bigger crop ?  why they pump co2 inside ,  of course !  !  !  co2 is not the problem ,  it ' s you people who say there ' s too much co2 ,  you are the problem .  our energy bills are skyrocketing we will go back to the  ' 60 ' s ,  when we had power cuts ,  because of the miner ' s strikes .  remember ,  without co2 ,  we would not be here . 
__label__0 great way to commute .  the shower facilities are not always available in offices .  riding in winter is very dangerous .  nevertheless it is a good way to mix up the transport options .  just one reminder ,  kindly be aware of the autos on the roads .  they paid road tax and the cyclist don ' t .  i have seen many times how one cyclist holds up the whole road with his inconsiderate cycling manners .  that is bad reputation for all cyclists due to 1 bad cyclist .  share the road but not hog the road
__label__0 this article certainly explains quite a lot about the idiocy rampant amongst middle management at some swiss companies . 
__label__0 1st .  freedom is always good .  .  . to choose your partner ,  to safe ,  to skydive .  .  .  2nd .  if you don ' t want to work on sundays don ' t apply for the job or change schedule / position / employer .  some of you guys have a problem understanding the non aggression principle and forget or decide to ignore that laws are nothing but opinions backed by guns and a prison system .  .  . good ideas don ' t need the use of force .  let companies open 24 / 7 .  .  . they compete for labor ,  and if labor under those conditions becomes too expensive then they will change plans .  .  . people will vote by shopping .  now if you thing you know better because your analysis is so superior to that aggregated in a free market ,  then please invest and become a multibillionaire and change the world with your money and influence into the wonderful place you envision .  .  . 
__label__0 fully agree with jakob büchler .  the idea of a professional army is utter nonsense .  just watch the difficulties the customs and police forces have to find enough recruits .  not to mention the cost to be borne by the tax payers . 
__label__0 basically agree with you that the citizens should think twice before granting the central government more power to the detriment of the autonomy of the cantons .  the terms "left" and "right" are relative .  for the majority of journalists ,  the socialists  ( now called social democrats )  are defined as "center-left" ,  possibly because they occupy the seats left to the center in parliament .  the green party sits adjacent to the left of the socialists .  .  . 
__label__0 why are wine sales down ?  in a word ,  "pricing" .  like many other consumables such as food ,  we in switzerland often pay double the price of other european countries .  when asked why ,  the response is simply "we accept high prices because that ' s what you must pay to live in switzerland" .  i wonder if or when swiss consumers and sellers will have a different view of pricing .  an example .  i recently decided to have some book shelving made for my home .  the quote from a swiss furniture maker was chf4 , 000 .  the price from across our border was euros1 , 500 .  guess who got the business .  i clearly prefer to purchase goods and products here in switzerland ,  but ofter the difference is simply too great ,  and inflicts too much pain on my bank account !

__label__0 the people of switzerland are to be blamed to have been soft skinned with liberals and now you are all paying the price all over the politics of "being nice" .  fact is that elected officials are obliged into correcting the flow of migration to switzerland .  fact is that switzerland must get rid of over b asylum seekers and reduce the limits of residency .  the land mass of switzerland .  switzerland is not a country that can sustain migrants for switzerland is too small .  the u .  . n reps should come up with the conclusion of which countries in the world are capable of receiving newcomers ,  for instance all those migrants that are overcrowding small nations can very well move to countries that need population increase like canada and many parts of latin america ,  doing so will reduce so many problems .  i hope someone that reads this makes it into a reality .  frankly  of migrants in switzerland are better of migrating to canada .  fact is that the best advice to migrants is to not go to europe rather come to canada or somewhere in latin america ,  take my word you are better of moving to any of these countries than to europe and if you are in europe already than what are you waiting for and get out of there as soon as possible and come to canada ,  canada is the best country in the world for migrants .  .  .

__label__0 okay .  .  .  . i am from an international multicultural multiracial family .  i have traveled the world .  i am a swiss american .  i have lived in the usa and switzerland .  i am sad to see such speculation and creating such a world drama because an employee and oprah seem to misinterpret each others communication and intentions .  i am also multilingual and i understand that language does not always translate literally and neither do cultural modus operandi .  i have received all types of service around the world as i have traveled most of my life with my international parents .  some service has been good and some not so good .  it depends on the skill level and situation of the person .  i have never taken it personally and have always attempted to work out a win win situation for myself and others .  of course i am not a big hollywood celebrity ,  i am a healer ,  i am a nurse ,  i spend my life trying to understand the needs and the meaning of others behavior in order to improve their situations .  oprah is an intelligent ,  educated ,  financially well off woman .  i am sure that if she wanted the purse she would have used all her talents to purchase the poor alligators hide .  she also could have avoided the whole blame flinging scandal by using all of her knowledge and people skills that she touted on her programs to work with the young lady in the store .  let us not be a part of this hysteria .  we are the human race .  we are one people .  let us seek the common ground and leave this whole mess to oprah to resolve .  okay oprah ,  show is on .  .  . let us see you utilize your understanding of human nature and establish peace here .  i do not blame the swiss .  i do not blame the young shop employee .  i do not blame oprah .  but i do know that oprah has the means to resolve this in a civil and appropriate fashion .  oprah does not make assumptions based on speculation .  right oprah ?  !  ?  !

" just after i was locked inside the apartment and not being able to get out for half an hour .  i am very lucky that there wasn ' t a fire .  and the landlord still insisted that the lock was just old and i should use my brain .  it appears that when people are locked inside their apartment  , not being able to go out is completely normal in switzerland ,  except when they don ' t have a brain . 
__label__0 first of all the sales clerk should be in the business of selling so if anyone asks for a product in the store ,  she should show it and try to make the sales because that is her job and from that point i would say the store owner should fire her for being incompetent .  .  .  . secondly what is oprah doing buying a handbag for $38000 ?  and she should be ashamed in trying to buy a handbag that is made out of innocent animals skin .  .  .  . where is peta in this ?  .  .  .  . and finally i think this has been a huge promotion for oprah exactly when she needs it as her movie is just being released .  .  . i see plenty of ignorance ,  incompetence and all around silliness but i do not see racism in this .

__label__0 one article that misses the smaller pictures of fading neutral class ,  you may not have nobility but apartheid is crawling .  everyone in switzerland is middle class ?  is that fact or utopian painting .  did you miss this article "the federal government has accepted poverty as a problem and a phenomenon in switzerland and has made it clear that something must be done . ” http: /  / www . swissinfo . ch / eng / swiss_news / first-time_funds_fight_poverty_with_education . html ? cid=36633994 class of its own indeed when looking at social gaps in a population .  asylum seekers this ,  that .  .  is generally the news ,  soon enough people are programed to discriminate .  further marginalizing fellow human beings thus making integration a challenge .  stop n frisk  ( without probable cause  ) due the color of your skin is a grey area for human rights abuses .  but you don ' t hear such things on the news .  oprah buying a bag is news .  well maybe things are a bit stirred and not shaken ,  in a way dialogue puts social challenges in the spotlight .  without employment opportunities through training and support for asylum seekers to obtain know-how and knowledge to integrate into the swiss job market how can you claim you have an open and neutral culture with a history for human rights ,  but lacking fair equal opportunity hiring practices .  isn ' t that creating a poverty class ,  as more swiss get older do you believe the social welfare system can sustain supporting asylum seekers ?  yes ,  switzerland has accepted many asylum seekers but should they be warehoused and forgotten ?  .  .  when people work it reduces the burden on social welfare leading to better services to senior citizens and above all reduces crime .  you see statistics on crime ommit comparative data .  surely is it only africans or blacks that traffic drugs or are merely mules in the mafia businesses .  it ' s easy to blame the small dealers  ( right ,  giving immunity to drug cartels organizations that employ the poor and desperate immigrants as street peddlers )  and not the users .  you can wrap it whichever way ,  but not all people in switzerland are middle class .

__label__0 now who does this finance minister eveline widmer-schlumpf think she is ?  the queen and ruler of switzerland now making further decisions ,  undoubtedly instigated and made by some of her cabinet members and of course the lobbyists that seemingly have taken over the  ' bundeshaus '  over the past decades . 
__label__1 mrs .  widmer-schlumpf came to power by betraying her own party and thus the people who had supported her .  she allied with the worse enemies of her former party to get a seat in the federal government .  she ran against the most competent and the most valued politician of all times ,  christoph blocher ,  who had single-handedly built up one of the biggest swiss corporations ,  then kept us out of the eu ,  thus preserving our rights and our far more advanced political and economic system .  as minister of justice ,  mr . blocher managed to reduce costs by over 20% ,  while improving the overall efficiency .  without any legal changes ,  the number of asylum requests went from 15 ' 000 to 7 ' 000 per year - his administration simply applied all the legal norms efficiently ,  thus making it unattractive for fraudulent demands .  since he was kicked out ,  asylum demands have jumped to 28 ' 000 per year ,  first under widmer-schlumpf ,  now sommaruga ,  a socialist .  mrs .  widmer-schlumpf ,  as traitor to her party ,  did exactly what could be expected: she now betrays her country !  that is absolutely undeniable .  she had the opportunity to block the oecd from adopting the new tax standard for automatic information exchange .  all she had to do was veto it - a right every member country has .  she refused to do so ,  claiming that it would make us "unpopular" .  as if politics were a matter of popularity .  or of morality .  it ' s economic war and she is surrendering !  this is just another step that shows that she always finds excuses to side with those who want to destroy us ,  because we are a thorn in their side .  she is surrendering our sovereignty little by little .  there has never been a worse politician in swiss history .  of course it would have been better not to have an agreement at all than to have such a completely evil one !  ews is lying when she says that it conforms to oecd standards .  it does not .  she doesn ' t even have the right to sign such a treaty ,  which violates the federalist principle - taxation is a matter of canton law ,  not federal law .  we must remove ews from the government !  and the eu must finally come to realize that they have nothing to gain by destroying the one country in europe that is doing well .  they should instead copy all the things switzerland has been doing right for the last 200 years and that made it the most prosperous country in the world .  maximum local autonomy ,  internal tax competition ,  direct democracy ,  no ruling party ,  proportionate representation for all parties ,  low taxes ,  maximum liberty ,  free trade !

__label__0 i was born and raised in the u . s .  however both of my parents are from asia .  i ' ve lived in switzerland for 27 years .  it was only when i had my first child did the doctors discover that i was a carrier of hepatitis b which is very contagious .  they had to quarantine me .  .  . i had my own bathroom and all caregivers during my maternity stay in the hospital had to wear latex gloves when they administered to me .  hepatitis can be carried over when those who are carriers don ' t wash their hands and also through bodily fluids .  this would be a valid reason to be cautious with refugees . 
__label__0 hepatitis b ?  have you been an asylum seeker ?  the intake centres have good health measures of screening for diseases before asylum seeker are assigned a canton .  such wild remarks lack facts and serve one purpose ,  exclusion .  how many people did you infect with hepatitis b before you got pregnant and how long had you lived in switzerland before you got pregnant ?  how did you arrive in switzerland ,  because you are exposing some national borders entry failures and not an asylum seeker health alert .  would you like it if people assumed all asians carry a risk of bird flu ?  and for that reason alone quarantine a whole group of asians ? 
__label__0 i have never patronized a prostitute but judging from the photo i can ' t imagine someone wanting to have sex on a mattress on the floor of an open-air garage .  a gang of thieves could rob a client while he is occupied .  on a different note ,  you can buy a one-day prostitution permit for chf 5 . - from a vending machine ?  sounds like an interesting souvenir .  maybe someone could sell these online on ebay ? 
__label__0 hallo jurg ,  your criticism of c . g .  jung - fondness for facism and admiration for hitler - is historically wrong and has been used since 1934 in order to degrade jung and his theories .  criticisms do not become more true by repetition .  there have been some remarks of jung in 1934 about "differences between germanic and jewish psychology" that could be and were misunderstood and widely used against him and his reputation .  jung himself rejected the accusations of antisemitism from the very beginning - and was supported by famous jewish followers of his psychology already in 1934 .  it would take too much space to show this in detail .  you talk of intense research efforts that should occur: they did occur .  if you read the literature about this issue you will admit: there is no word ,  no sentence of jung in the thirties that has not been thoroughly discussed .  last ,  let me give you some evidence of the supposed fondness and admiration: in 1936 ,  the year of the olympic games in berlin ,  when hitler´s political reputation in germany was at a summit ,  jung wrote an essay called "wotan" ,  where he talks about a mass psychosis in germany and of hitler as an "ergriffener"  ( "a state of being seized or possessed" )  and "ergreifer" of the german masses in psychopathological categories .  admiration means something else to me .  in 1939 ,  several months before the beginning of world war 2 ,  he gave an interview to the cosmopolitan in new york with the title "diagnosing the dictators" ,  hitler and stalin .  jung was very much concerned about how to save democracy in the west in this interview and called america the last resort of western democracy .  in the end of the interview jung gave the americans an advice: it would be impossible to stop hitler at once without the great catastrophe for all .  the americans should wait: "you must keep away from the craze ,  avoid the infection .  keep your army and navy large ,  but save them .  if war comes ,  wait .  .  you are the last resort of western democracy . " anybody in germany who would have said such sentences in germany would have been imprisoned in a concentration camp or hanged immediately .  c . g .  jung clearly stood at the side of western democracy in world war 2 and against hitler .  i propose to follow the facts and not prejudices and ideologies .  dr .  günter langwieler  ( berlin ,  germany ) "
__label__0 whether this apology was warranted depends on the action of swiss banks .  if the banks didn ' t actively promote tax evasion and it was the clients who approached the banks ,  then there was no moral need to apologise ,  in which case i would argue that the us has been dictatorial .  does anyone really think that every bank in the world should be fully conversant with the tax laws in every country and act as if it were the tax authorities in each of those other countries ?  of course not .  on the other hand ,  if the us-based offices of the swiss banks were saying "hide you money with us" then it ' s a bit different .  what a pity the article doesn ' t clarify matters .

__label__0 the swiss executive comes across as a bunch of small time timid finaglers with the vision of blinkered horses .  why not go full blast ,  embracing trusts ?  just do the same and shame the uk ,  the us .  where are the suave international finance top shots with connections a la hildebrand ?  larry fink of blackrock ,  even warren buffett could add a good word or two in appropriate influential circles in london and washington .  where is the crude ,  common sense loudmouth blocher ,  making outrageous statements and thus getting applauding headlines ,  gaining sympathy and support in the tea party heartland of the us of a - guaranteed !  where is the powerful lobby the swiss are using in washington ,  london ?  i haven ' t heard a peep .  yep ,  maybe it will cost a few hundred millions but worth every penny if the best of class are being hired .  just ask the south koreans ,  the israelis ,  how it is done .  oh ,  of course ,  they might be all a bit too  ' right wing '  and undiplomatic ,  according to the oh so thin-skinned and consensual tip-toeing do-good leftish swiss government .  where are your courageous sons and daughters ,  helvetia ?  sometimes one wishes a bit of the not so good old mercenary days back ,  when the swiss knew at least how to fight .  the new national sport of the swiss appears to be indulging in self-flagellation ,  even inviting others to steamroll over the bleeding carcasses .  what a shame . 
__label__0 without taking sides in this debate ,  may i just point out that "correlation is not causation" .  the reduction in cycling in australia and new zealand  ( cited on the map )  has not been shown to arise from the introduction of helmets .  potential cyclists in australia do not say: "oh !  no !  i would love to cycle but i refuse to do so because i would have to wear a silly helmet . " in fact ,  the culture in australia is generally to support helmets - especially for children - because parents don ' t want them to be injured .  the reduction in cycling hours is more plausibly due to australia ' s high level of urbanisation  ( about 65% of australians live in the state and territory capital cities )  ,  the ever-worsening road traffic ,  and the fact that the cities were never designed with cyclists in mind . 
__label__0 got into an accident and didn ' t wear a helmet ?  no insurance coverage !  what gets me is to see a mother riding her bike ,  no helmet ,  and the little son / daughter wearing one .  isn ' t the life of the mother more important ? 
__label__0 swiss systems  ( usually )  work really well ,  but the process to put them in place can be really slow using direct democracy .  on many voting forms ,  i am surprised to see the yes option ,  as many swiss would prefer to maintain the status quo by saying no until they are convinced a system will work .  an ongoing battle between the cave-dwellers  ( who say no to change )  and those who want to improve life and take a chance on something new  ( the risk-takers )  .

__label__0 i seriously doubt that conscription in switzerland has much to do with national defense anymore .  it is however ,  an excellent foundation for patriotism ,  team and character building . it should be mandatory for swiss women as well since swiss women are gaining equality . 
__label__0 those religions are in clear violation of human rights by stressing the tolerance of others what about the non muslims that are being stressed to tolerate their discriminatory demands on the non muslim population ,  they hate jews and non muslims .  does human rights means that racists can be racists and pedophiles can be pedophiles only if they register them selves as a religious entity ?  human rights does not mean that groups of people can violate the rule of law by simply registering themselves as a religion .  wake up and rise against evil send them back from where they would be a clear victim of their own evil .  .  .

__label__0 it is mindboggling to me that the main argument about accepting this discriminatory religious practice lies in the financial gains to switzerland .  as long as money and gold flows into switzerland ,  feel free to treat any portion of your society however bad you like .  sounds eerily familiar …

__label__0 it ' s the same with chile ,  statistics show the richness of the few ,  but social inequality remains . 
__label__0 although the idea behind this proposal appeals to a sense of fairness and justice ,  it would simply be a disaster .  most of the companies effected will be large ,  international firms that employ a lot of people both in switzerland and outside switzerland .  they will not increase wages to make this work but will instead look to move the company headquarters .  companies that were considering locating here will now put that on hold or not come .  the initiative in effect is attacking the decision makers which would work if switzerland would be their only choice of location but it is not .  this would only work if all countries signed up .  people need to wake up to reality on this .  vote no . 
__label__0 2 wrongs do not make 1 right .  stolen data cannot be used to prosecute tax evasion people .  much like tortured testaments are disallowed in courts in most parts of the world and forced entry into people ' s homes and property automatically disallows evidence to be admitted in court .  so stolen client data should be automatically disallowed as proof in court of law  ( internationally )  .  this will also discourage governments from stealing data and paying for them .  their past actions  ( and payments )  encourage people to break swiss laws . 
__label__0 "switzerland remains the most train-loving nation in the world  .  .  .

__label__1 well tip of the iceberg is correct .  it ' s time to make proper judgement in the whole global aspect of banking and clarity of governance .  this happened due to a lack of responsibility from the managers of the banks and bank associations for allowing bankers to bank dirty money .  that is why it is important to put organizations such as the mormons to a halt of the theft of wealth that they are doing across the world ,  they are a good example; they charge of the income of their members plus they make them buy  ' magical garments" which are made of poor quality so memebers buy them often ,  they make their members purchase new books that that church releases every 3 months ,  and they have to devote 0 of their time to their church ,  they go untaxed and in fact that demand fi nacial support from governments ,  they cause deficits in the countries which they operate in and create a surplus for the state of utah ,  they go untaxed and all those who have direct business interest with that church have secret bank accounts which go untaxed ,  irs does nothing for they are creating deficits in foreign nations and a surplus for the u . s .  mind you it is clear ,  stop the mormons !  !  ! 
__label__0 spying aside ,  i believe that most people are missing the whole picture .  the us and europe are involved in  ' free trade '  talks and while the spying is unsettling it is also a distraction from those talks .  if free trade between europe and the us comes about then we in europe will be forced to accept the import of us genetically modified products such as food stuffs ,  seeds for the agriculture industry and meat and dairy products contaminated with growth hormones and antibiotics .  this to me is totally unacceptable and would also be a one sided situation favouring us farmers .

__label__1 the e . u .  is very well mismanaged and therefore dysfunctional ,  switzerland play the major role in balancing and stabilizing the e . u .  ,  the independence of switzerland will always remain as such ,  the swiss ethnicity is a strong and stern culture which has endured various attempts to disintegrate swiss culture and have not succeed from the romans to napoleon to the current attempts from our dear heat stroked neighbors ,  switzerland will persevere now and the future just as how it has done in the past .  the people of switzerland are a true example of how a human being should behave .  the e . u .  is just an ideal from a group of people who had a vision but did not have a global understanding of their vision ,  e . u .  members should praise the swiss for not have given into becoming an e . u .  for if switzerland would have had become a member ,  all european countries the u . s . a .  ,  canada ,  australia and japan would have had been a thing of the past just like argentina was .  for nations to be successful even with the new world order model it is important to maintain nations sovereign in order to ensure a healthy dynamic of interaction among the global population as a whole .  frankly the world powers ow well deserved respect to the people of switzerland for being stubborn for the swiss people have saved the world from becoming a planet of chaos and failure .  the e . u .  is very lucky to be a neighbor of switzerland .  .  .

__label__0 the picture reflects a scene that is seen around the globe where poor workers  ( construction slaves ,  maids ,  domestic help ,  etc )  send money home .  they do not use banks - they use shops set up in convenient locations  ( eg western union ,  etc )  - some of which are money laundering operations in the 3rd world countries .  the reason is that poor people do not have bank accounts ,  they only recognize cash and this helps convert worthless 3rd world currency into hard currency .  very lucrative business model - charge senders a hefty fee as well as the money launderers a fee for converting their black money into a real currency to be stored in international banks - safe from local eyes . 
__label__0 there are two especially relevant statements in this article: "swiss banking secrecy is an economic decision taken by switzerland to foster its strong banking activity .  that’s not sufficient justification for the harm done to us through massive tax evasion . " and .  .  .  "if you want to do business in the us ,  you have to abide by our laws .  '  as much as people want to make this into an issue of swiss national pride and independence ,  it ' s really about ethical behavior and economic realities .  tax evasion or fraud ,  despite what swiss law says ,  are simply unethical .  it ' s a form of robbery ,  trying to get something  ( government and civil structure )  for nothing ,  or for less .  furthermore ,  the swiss simply need to do business in the us .  despite all the talk of swiss looking east to countries like china ,  or south to countries like brazil ,  the reality is that the us market is absolutely vital to switzerland ' s economy ,  and will be for a long time .  therefore ,  switzerland has to change its laws to participate in international trade .  despite a few vocal politicians who try to attract instinctive ,  fear-based ,  nationalistic and isolationist votes from within switzerland ,  most swiss politicians and business people understand these facts .  that ' s why switzerland has continued to work slowly and productively with the us .  first ,  they know that it is the right thing to do ,  and second ,  they have no choice .  that ' s the modern world .

__label__0 let think of the culture and language too .  without culture ,  language and borders there is no country .  most immigrants do not want to be swiss but are bringing their own culture ,  just like in the usa . 
__label__0 it is not just immigrants forcing the swiss out of work .  there are also thousands of foreign students doing courses that require swiss internships .  these students work for less than half the minimum salary ,  doing the job of full time staff ,  who end up unemployed ,  unable to find full time work again . 
__label__0 i ' m glad you enjoyed it .  the piece at the end is known as the appenzeller landsgemeindelied ,  or alternatively as ode an gott  ( ode to god )  .  the version at the end of the podcast was sung by the männerchor frohsinn on a 1994 cd called so gfallts de appezeller .  incidentally ,  did you see the written features and video about the appenzell anniversary that we carried on december 5th ?   ( appenzell marks 500 years of swissness )  best wishes to you too ,  and keep listening in 2014 ! 
__label__0 well ,  that is just another rotten proposition that the citizens have to vote .  it has been clarified before that although pregnancy is not an illness ,  the basic health insurance  ( called sickness insurance in our official languages )  has to cover all the related costs .  even if you are opposed to abortion for ethical reasons ,  it will happen anyway .  therefore ,  it is preferable that the operation be performed in a hospital by a competent surgeon rather than in an obscure back shack . 
__label__0 an abortion is between the woman and the medical personnel ,  it is not an issue for the general public .  saying that insurance isn ' t going to cover abortions because of irresponsible behavior ,  is ridiculous as you can say that for virtually any illness .  the bible doesn ' t mention abortion ,  the roman church only brings up the issue for political purposes .  if it was up to the church we ' d be living under the inquisition . 
__label__0 i am from vancouver ,  canada and i wanted to say that the russian gov .  used polonium to poison an opponent of its gov .  so no wonder the russian gov .  don ' t agree that arafat was poisoned .  also the french gov .  is a supporter of israel so it don ' t agree that arafat was poisoned . that ' s not a surprise .  the truth is that arafat was poisoned by the israeli gov .  the israeli gov .  got lots of experience in doing these sort of things . 
__label__0 have they done any dna testing to determine the origin of the infestation .  with dna results ,  you can often trace or better determine where and how alb entered ,  e . g .  wood pallets ,  firewood ,  infested nursery stock ,  etc .  just to correct ,  so far as the research shows ,  an alb-infested tree will definitely die due to extensive larval damage throughout the phloem and xylem of the tree . 
__label__0 switzerland must stand up for these workers and take the french government to court for double dipping ,  impedimg economic stability amongst the people of france .  it is clearly irrational and imoral to force a citizen to pay into 2 insurance schemes when the non private will not be used for the private is expected to cover the individual ,  this also causes many logistics issues regarding the provisions of care where the private insurance will not cover as certain liability while the national insurance won ' t cover the individual for the individual has a private insurance thus not properly protecting the ensured iindividual thus creating impunity ,  however switzerland could mediate a split of costs so to reduce costs for both private and national insurances thus providi g an equateble and reasonably just asurance of care for the bearer of the insurance . 
__label__0 asylum seekers should only be in switzerland for asylum not migration that being said refugees should return to their homeland as soon as political conflict is no longer a general threat to the population .  .  . 
__label__0 finally ,  the dollar may be put to rest !  then the us can really start working on their own problems and leave the rest of the world alone ! 
__label__0 @itza: the number of subsidized housing objects  ( called social flats )  is so small that it cannot be a major factor for the rising housing cost .  it is more likely due to a combination of several other factors .  the construction of apartments for rent has fallen behind the fast growing population .  in several cities older houses with affordable rents have been replaced with new buildings .  higher construction costs and modern equipment automatically caused higher rents .  often they consisted of luxury flats with a rent that reaches or exceeds the income of an average working person .  land available for construction is getting scarcer and more expensive ,  especially in densely populated areas .  many real estate promoters have preferred to build for sale rather than rent because it is more lucrative .  several ways to alleviate the problem are considered or used to encourage the construction of more affordable apartments .  allowing higher buildings or selling land owned by the communes at a reasonable prize with the obligation to guarantee moderate rents .  apartment houses that generate a net rental income  ( irr )  of five or six per cent are still attractive for pension funds in the light of the extremely low interest rates available from high quality bonds .  for many people buying a property is simply beyond reach .  therefore tackling with the housing problem is an absolute necessity .  .  . 
__label__0 or they could send the waste to a plasma gasification facility at 8000 degrees c there would be nothing left except the syngas
__label__0 all the more reason to vote yes .  we should not roll over and let the eu bully us .  developing markets in asia and latin america could make up for any losses across the eu .  bring to a halt any assistance with tax evasion if the eu wants to shut us out . 
__label__0 so the destruction of switzerland begins .  .  . 
__label__0 the problem is that too many jobs were outsourced to china and other parts of the orient .  cheap labour that meant immense riches for the companies '  ceos and share holders .  the problem also is that banks were rescued at all costs at the expense of the taxpayers .  another problem is that all these greedy shysters are still walking around free ,  enjoying the fruits ,  not of their labour ,  but off of the backs of cheaply paid workers .  the only thing that davos will accomplish is: the rich figuring out more ways to fleece us .  same ,  old same . 
__label__0 ridiculous comment about people being too educated .  hello !  the people with college degrees have a much higher employment rate than those with just a high school education .  the young kid who made that statement got lucky and is not indicative of people without degrees .  the problem is not that people are too educated ,  the problem is that companies do not believe in training their employees .  when i started in workplace 40 years ago it was expected that you had to train new employees .  now they don ' t think it ' s their responsibility . 
__label__0 the majority of swiss people do not want to  ' integrate '  into the eu as cottier puts it .  it is beyond me why on earth any sane person would even want to be part of such an undemocratic and corrupt institution as the eu .  for the last 19 years the eu has not had its books signed off because it cannot account for billions of lost euros that have just disappeared !  ! 
__label__0 every country can assimilate only so many immigrants and refugees .  switzerland has done its share quite gracefully .  what is especially praiseworthy is that they employ asylum seekers in creative employment - like the one shown of cleaning the woods .  how much more constructive is that than to hold asylum seekers in immigration centers like the us does ,  where those centers are essentially prisons and families are often divided ,  children separated from their parents .  the us could learn a lot from tiny switzerland - last but not least how to treat people with respect and dignity . 
__label__0 what really kills me about this ,  is the fact that switzerland has totally abandoned their own citizens .  if an individual is a swiss citizen ,  regardless of any other citizenship they hold ,  they are entitled to confidentiality of their swiss assets held in switzerland .  i can understand full disclosure if the account holder is not also a swiss citizen; but honestly ,  you guys are not really worthy of running your country if you ' re ready to sell out your own citizens .  .  . i don ' t care how big a stick the us wields . 
__label__0 hopefully the secret services do not stop at simply monitoring the situation .  these people are either criminals or maniacs and should be detained the sooner the better . 
__label__0 if you can ' t beat them ,  then you must join them ,  there are so many ways to protect to protect data regardless of the circumstances .  no matter what the circumstance may be ,  people always have alternatives to avoid unwanted problems .  .  .

__label__0 it would help if the swiss spoke some high german or english and be a bit  (  a lot )  more friendly on the slopes
__label__0 the canton bern  ( and some others )  is desperately trying to balance the budget by cutting expenses and increasing tax revenue .  .  . 
__label__0 as an eu citizen working here i would now expect the eu to protect my interests .  if the swiss will not accept free movement i expect similar restrictions to be placed on the swiss across the eu and for all bilateral agreements to be removed .  this is a far right policy from a far right party and it will lead to more extreme restrictions on "auslanders" in time .  .  .  . the far right has only one final goal the elimination of everything that is "different" . 
__label__0 it ' s interesting the greed of businesses are not interested in what the people want .  the new cap on immigration ,  which i believe will pass ,  is not saying "no immigration . " people will always want to come to switzerland to work .  switzerland was prosperous before the freedom of movement they will be prosperous afterwards .  they can ' t continue to fill the country up to the breaking point with people ,  they must deal with the situation from within the country not hide behind it with more people . 
__label__0 so the xenophobic swiss have shot themselves in the foot and do not realise it .  the impact will be immense .  they have put their innate xenophobia above the economy of the country .  fact - the swiss are not talented enough for many of the positions filled by "foreigners" .  fact - switzerland needs the eu as a trading partner .  fact - "foreigners" are employed in roles which the swiss believe are beneath them; fact - "foreign" companies will cease to open offices here which will adversely impact local economies .  time will demonstrate the naiveté of this vote result . 
__label__0 let ' s be clear ,  this issue has nothing to do with xenophobia .  our economy needs foreign talents and the approved initiative does not contain a number but rather wants to stem the excessive flow of immigrants .  comparable to rain that is useful until you get too much resulting in inundations ! 
__label__0 the swiss should send christoph blocher to renegotiate immigration quote in brussels .  i don ' t think so he will do it he doesn ' t have balls for it matter ,  great leader have won the swiss on sunday !  !  it ' s as an artificial outcome generated by the well-funded campaign of an individual mastermind ,  christoph blocher of the swiss people’s party ,  rather than a genuine reflection of the swiss mood .  he indicated that anti-immigrant movements inside the eu ,  such as geert wilders’ pvv party in the netherlands ,  jean-marie le pen’s front national in france ,  and heinz-christian strache’s fpo in austria follow the same model .  “mr blocher ,  the chief of this idea ,  maybe has lots of money ,  but i think he is shortsighted .  you can see the kind of people who share his ideas - wilders ,  le pen ,  strache - he’s in good company , ”
__label__0 it would be a shame if this referendum created commercial consequences for switzerland - with eu citizens now deciding not to buy swiss cheese ,  chocolate or pharmaceuticals any more .  it should be interesting reading ,  in the next few years ,  to see the results across eu markets that companies like lindt or sandoz or nestle  ( and others )  will have .  will it be - as a song says - "all about the money" ? 
__label__0 i love it !  what will happen is a domino effect .  countries that didn ' t have the courage to stand up to the eu will do so now .  i predict that within the next 5 to 10 years the eu will be done .  it ' s not necessary and not working for many countries .  bravo switzerland ! 
__label__0 “in terms of reciprocity ,  it ' s not appropriate that swiss citizens have unrestricted freedom of movement in the eu - i think there are 430 , 000 here ,  which in relative terms is more than the one million european citizens that are in switzerland , ” he said .  .  .  .  either the above statement has been written incorrectly ,  or m .  barroso needs to get a lesson in maths .  430 ' 000 over 500 mio is relatively more than 1 mio over 5 mio ?  doesn ' t sound right .  i for one support this initiative because why should the europeans get a beneficial treatment over everyone else in the world ?  non-euefta have always had quotas .  as m .  burkhalter said ,  its not the end of the world . 
__label__0 my husband &amp; i have had a small chalet in the french part of switzerland for 25 years .  he has swiss ancestors .  we have seen tremendous changes take place in our local area mainly with building projects .  it ' s hard to maintainn a culture in today ' s global environment but in large part i believe that this is what the swiss people would like .  so would i .  tourism plays a major role in the swiiss economy &amp; most tourists want to see swiss villages not huge mega apartment complexes .  traffic causing long backups on the highways causes everyone tremendous stress not to mention trying to find a parking space once you have arrived at your destination .  the free movement of people is hard to argue against as well as the sanctions that might harm the swiss economy .  i wish there was a simple good answer .  hopefully there will be reasonable compromises that reduce but not stop the ability of people to move through out the eu . 
__label__0 as an american living here is switzerland for 10 years ,  i have seen a steady decline in quality of life .  after the eu agreements ,  crime has gone up ,  gypsies are everywhere ,  roads are crowded ,  salaries are down ,  etc .  i had to apply to have the privilege to stay in this country and feel this is how it should be .  congratulations and thank you to the citizens of switzerland !  ! 
__label__0 good for you ticino .  however ,  i am surprised the french speaking part of switzerland said non to restricting immigration .  they also have a huge cross-border worker problem .  this problem is simply caused by greedy capitalist bosses trying to save money on salaries to make more profit .  this practice needs to be stopped .  employ swiss first ,  everyone else last .  simple .

__label__0 the brunnenvergifter from herrliberg and his party have succeeded in creating a climate in switzerland where real and perceived problems are exploited for political gains and the foreigners are called the culprits .  thus we have said no to the bilaterale with europe after we have said yes five or six times .  unfortunately the switzerland of the 70ies that they want to create is not on offer anymore .  the eu will not accept contingentation .  people have it too good in switzerland .  i am afraid ,  it has to get worse which it will with the economic uncertainty and the loss of opportunities in europe which have already started ,  energy ,  horizon2020 and erasmus have been put on ice .  i hope that kohler is correct in that this majority will get reversed once we will have to vote on the implementation of the mei which might turn out to be a simple question: does switzerland want to keep the bilaterales or cancel them ?

__label__0 switzerland ' s politicians are still breathtakingly naïve when dealing with the us ,  and should ensure voters agree with any proposals .  a classic sign of trouble is the us attempting to have a different set of rules than the rest - either all do the same or this should not happen at all .  swiss politicians should not forget us machinations to use switzerland as a diversion from the fact that wall street caused yet another global economic crisis ,  so the us doesn ' t exactly have a sterling track record for setting rules .  let the  ( swiss )  buyer beware: the us has no reservations about using any tool at hand to protect us interests ,  and us interests alone .  benevolence is not their strong suit . 
__label__0 a war could happen anywhere ,  but the fact is that a war hasn ' t happened between ,  to use your example ,  france and germany ,  since the formation of the eu .  in the c . 70 years between 1870 and 1939 ,  they had three .  in the c . 70 years since 1945 ,  they ' ve had none , and both they and their neighbours - including switzerland - are more prosperous as a result .

__label__0 do you realize that when i go out and vote in a parliamentary election that my vote will have absolutely no impact on the government it ushers in ?  why ?  because the political parties have made an agreement as to how the government is constituted which frustrates our voting intentions .  even after a significant conservative vote we did not get the additional conservative of our choice  ( an additional svp seat )  ,  we got an additional conservative of their choice !  so no heinz ,  our democracy is just as broken as the next . 
__label__1 i certainly agree that the eu has a way to go in democratic process ,  and the disgraceful treatment of roma in france ,  quite alike under governments of supposedly very different characters ,  clearly indicates that .  supporting an ill-considered breach of international treaty won ' t help this ,  though ,  and might well worsen it .  way too much of the commentary on these pages sounds like people who ,  having been persuaded to turn out the lights in the house ,  are now whistling in the dark . 
__label__1 @657 , switzerland: why don ' t you get off your svp bashing waggon and accept the fact that a high percentage of the 50 . 3%  ' yes '  voters were not svp members or followers at all .  we now see more  ' hate mail '  in swiss newspaper coming out of the liberal sp / left wing faction than ever . 
__label__1 they should apply to be swiss .  i wasn ' t born here but i have a swiss passport . 
__label__1 swiss benefits should be paid to swiss nationals and swiss citizens only .  if a foreigner becomes unemployed ,  best is to give them a lump sum payment ,  and send them home again .  most of the unemployed here are foreigners .  how many are benefit tourists ,  i wonder  ? 
__label__1 the fact that switzerland has an unemployment rate of 3-3 . 5% is evidence of the fact that foreigners are not in fact "stealing jobs" from the swiss .  there are clearly more jobs being created than qualified swiss can take .  you ' re better off sticking to a cultural argument against immigration . 
__label__1 lynx you are so true .  i bet most of them were from out of country . 
__label__1 remember that the vote was passed with a 0 . 3% "majority" ,  a mere 19 , 500 or so votes ,  with 55% turnout .  don ' t ignore the sizable part of the population that either did not vote for the initiative ,  or were indifferent to it . 
__label__0 10000 demonstrators  ,  each takes a family of new immigrant arrivals into their home = about 40000 people taken care of  ,  its a good start  . 
__label__1 the open question here is ,  how many of the 10 , 000 participants in this  ' crowd show '  were actually and in fact swiss citizens ?  pictures in swiss newspapers show many  ' disguised / hooded '  subjects carrying large signs with disgusting ,  offensive  (  ' expletive '  )  lyrics up front of this ,  according to some swiss newspaper ,  unsanctioned demonstration in bern .  i would not be surprised that a large percentage of the participants in this demonstration were possibly immigrants with  ' questionable status '  in switzerland . 
__label__1 yes ,  i will not ignore it .  at the same time ,  i will also ask you not to ignore the sizeable part of the swiss population  ( one-third )  that voted in favour of the initiative limiting public funds for abortions .  unlike the “losing” side on the initiative for limiting immigration ,  the "losing" side on the abortion initiative  ( voted the same day )  gets absolutely *no* press coverage whatsoever from swissinfo .  i would like to see them do an in-depth analysis on items such as: 1 )  women who deeply regret choosing abortions through coercion or misinformation  ( there are many out there ) ; 2 )  individuals whose consciences are seared and violated daily knowing their hard-earned money is paying to kill someone else ' s offspring  ( where is the option for conscientious-objection ?  ) ; 3 )  the money-making industry behind the abortion mill; or 4 )  the inconsistency conundrum of abortionists who want free abortions on demand ,  yet seek to limit it in the case of gender-selection  ( if an abortion is the equivalent of removing a tumour ,  why limit it ?  if a foetus is not a human being ,  why worry about gender ?  )  .  where are the reports on these issues ?  why can’t swissinfo be as in-your-face about this losing side ?  but i won ' t be holding my breath since swissinfo ideology is not interested in balanced reporting . 
__label__1 the fact that switzerland has an unemployment rate of 3-3 . 5% is evidence of the fact that foreigners are not in fact "stealing jobs" from the swiss .  there are clearly more jobs being created than qualified swiss can take .  you ' re better off sticking to a cultural argument against immigration . 
__label__1  ' one banner read "switzerland without foreigners is like swiss chocolate without cacao" .  '  yes ,  but too much cacao and the chocolate turns quite bitter . 
__label__1 the image of switzerland is excellent and always will be !  i personally think that the swiss vote makes them stronger in the eyes of their neighbours .  if the truth be known other countries would do likewise if they had a true democratic electoral system like that of the swiss .  i am tired of the bullying ,  scaremongering tactics employed by brussels to try and turn the tide with the faint-hearted and undecided . 
__label__0 the catholic church has had her share of controversies and bad press .  it is a shameful thing when one or many of their leaders are accused and then found guilty of child abuse or any abuse .  they are not the right people for the gospel of jesus christ .  i only want to say this to the people .  there are many trees in the forest .  some trees are rotten and some trees smell bad .  but this does not mean all trees are rotten and poisonous .  there are many christians out there who follow the steps of jesus christ and protect and nurture young people and love them like jesus .  not all christians are like these demonic priests .  may you be fair and not judge all churches and all christians and all catholics the same way . 
__label__0 it ' s really not easy to have a valid discussion about a topic when some people are basically speaking from the vantage point of stereotypes regarding others .  what do you know about all americans ?  it is a very big country-- not like tiny ch .  have you lived in all the regions of the usa ?  have you been an executive in all the regions of the usa and across various industries ?  do you know any american families and how they live ?  i think you are just talking about what you have seen on tv or in glossy magazines .  it might surprise you ,  but some would say the swiss are not social minded .  they generally hate foreigners and are unwelcoming .  the swiss have aided and abetted global criminal activity behind the veil of "secrecy laws" for decades .  in doing so ,  ch has sucked money out of other countries '  coffers ,  both rich and poor ,  with no regard for the suffering it causes others .  what is so social-minded about that ?  it ' s selfish for sure .  .  . 
__label__0 i have been employed by both foreign and swiss bosses here and i prefer swiss ones ,  as they seem to care more for their staff .  swiss standards have fallen over the last 20 years .  could it be simply because the foreign bosses put quantity profit before quality ? 
__label__0 it is a pure numbers games .  ordinary people will buy ordinary cars every 5 to 10 years .  these cars do not break down and therefore the car makers only make a profit from their sales  ( every 5 to 10 years )  or their maintenance .  if the car-makers make expensive and exotic cars for the new rich ,  they can sell them to these rich people every year or even every 6 months .  these rich people will buy a 1million usd bugatti which has a waiting list and they also need expensive maintenance costs .  so if you are a car-maker ,  which type of cars will you make ,  so that your company will have healthy profits every year ?  economic cars or expensive cars ?  electric cars and fuel-saving cars do not even impact any rich guy .  they expect their cars to be fully filled up every day .  why ?  because money is easy for them ? 
__label__1 "new president arseniy yatsenyuk" - arseniy yatsenyuk is not a new president ,  he is a new prime minister .  the acting president of ukraine is oleksandr turchynov .

__label__0 and almost all countries have practiced this at one time or another .  but ,  the swiss are among the biggest deniers of their history that i have ever met . 
__label__0 it certainy is  ' warming '  to see some real and positive switzerland / swiss history related article on this  ' swissinfo '  homepage again . 
__label__0 the swiss are too high maintenance .  they bring little to the international community and constantly snival and whine when they have created their own predicament .  low birth rates and an aversion to university study and hard work have left the swiss needing to import brainy workers .  the eu + uk and usa should ignore the swiss and leave them to sink or swim on their own which they haven ' t had to do for decades as they ' ve stolen from the coffers of rich and poor countries alike .  the only reason the swiss can survive without investing in a proper military while paying it ' s citizens inflated wages is because of being protected by bigger western countries .  the swiss have nothing special to offer the world and our continued protection of the swiss has resulted in a nation of xenophobic and arrogant under-acheivers who think they are entitled to getting special treatment !

__label__0 thank you to the federal government for stepping in to limit this damage .  i ' m no fan of political elites ,  but it seems they have their uses for the general good on occasion .  and thanks to swissinfo for continuing to report on an important-but-not-urgent topic that won ' t look like headline material but still needs airing . 
__label__0 you are right ,  it is like buying a house "on plan" .  the other unanswered question is: why buy new planes for an air force that is operational only during office hours .  the rather evasive explanations delivered so far by our defense minister may make hesitate more than one about the justification of this proposition . 
__label__0 co-op ' s are good when done in privet however when co-op ' s become part of subsidized housing programs its benefits are the opposite .  .  . 
__label__0 why do you focus on the us and not on the eu ' s position ?  the us is not leading this show or the sanctions would be harsher and europe would be without gas !  the eu is leading this dog and pony show  ( as it should )  since there is no threat to the us .  the us is simply helping its "friends" .  and as for russia ' s annexation of crimea ,  i think that is pretty much a yawn .  nobody really cares-- however ,  the message needs to be loud and clear that putin cannot run roughshod into europe without serious consequences .  when one ' s toe is infected with gangrene ,  the best idea is to cut off the toe and throw it away  ( like crimea in this case )  .  if your position  ( like that of many others on this website )  is that the us should stay out of this ,  i can agree with that so long as the us stays permanently out of it-- even after europe is directly threatened militarily or economically  ( as in oil / gas shortages )  .

__label__0 100% of comments are apologetic of russia ' s actions so far !  : )  you won ' t find such a consensus even in russia .  good to see westerners are waking up to the fact that the us ' s and the eu ' s regimes are hardly any more benign than russia ' s .  but then it ' s swiss web-site ,  so may be you ' ve known it for quite some time now .

__label__0 though i understand all the possible negative consequences of this ,  i can ' t stop but feel as it this has been blown out of proportion .  originally when we signed on to this free movement deal in 2002 ?  we expected about 8000 immigrants per year .  now we have over 80 ' 000 per year .  i think most swiss understand that our economy may very well suffer but this is the price we are willing to pay to preserve our country .  besides ,  if a company wants to hire from outside switzerland no one said they can ' t ,  this is limiting immigration ,  not cancelling it .  i ' m sure our government is working hard on a resolution that will satisfy both them ,  the eu ,  and the very concerned swiss .

"the rest of the 51% can head back to the ice age where the only shop they have is landi and nothing else . " this is *not* what the initiative was about either .  in case you missed it ,  let me spell it out: the initiative was about putting the brakes on unbridled ,  mass immigration ,  *not stopping it or reversing it* .  your sarcasm ,  insults ,  oversimplification and misrepresentation of a complex issue sheds more heat than light . 
__label__1 @ef i simply draw your attention to the fact that when parliament votes it only represents 0 . 00001% of the electorate; a few hundred members of parliament out of a voting population of several million is not a very big franchise at all  ( the fact they are "elected" means little precisely because the principal cannot communicate to an agent how they would vote on every single issue - a person might vote for someone because they like their views on issue x ,  y or z but not on issue a or b )  .  sometimes mps vote with only a third of the legislature being present  ( satisfying the quorum requirement )  .  compared to a few eu commissioners or parliament itself ,  30% of the electorate is vastly more legitimate than an other alternative .  also those who did not vote might do so because  ( 1 )  they delegate the decision to those who vote;  ( 2 )  they have confidence that their fellow citizens will make the correct decision ,  if not ,  they can always vote to repeal it if not by mounting a ballot initiative themselves ,  by asking parliament to put a counter-proposal on the ballot a few years later .  i also your note might be resolved by introducing compulsory voting ,  which at least once swiss canton has done . 
__label__1 “the social democrats called on the government to present a report weighing the current policy of bilateral treaties with the eu against the possibility of swiss membership in the 28-nation bloc . ” also heard this today on swiss tv news .  they obviously have still not understood that the majority of swiss citizens would not even think about an eu membership .  some political observers believe that the adhesion to the eec could have passed years ago if the socialists had refrained from their stupid talk about “anti-chamber towards full membership” .  meanwhile the opinion of the population in the romandie  ( who were then rather in favor )  has changed towards a clear no . 
__label__1 many companies will probably do what they should have been doing in the first place !  it all boils down to one thing: switzerland cannot handle the huge influx of people .  that ' s it .  they just have to work around it and everything will be fine .  i don ' t think the bilateral agreements are going to be a huge problem .  the majority of the eu countries are broke anyways and now that they ' ve taken on the money-pit the ukraine they will have more headaches .  they will keep the trade with switzerland because they benefit from switzerland as well .  all will end well .  .  .

__label__1 the ludicrous thing about this debate is that switzerland already has a quota system in place for eu immigrants ,  ever since the federal council activated the clause of safeguard last may .  the quota is around 58 , 000 b-permits a year .  no once seems to have even noticed this system is already in place as a temporary measure due to expire this june: it simply needs to be made permanent and the problem is solved . 
__label__1 ok everyone picture this; become member of the eu it will be nice they said and now they want you to vote to give up your heritage and your sovereignty ,  freedom and social ,  political and economic stability ,  lol ,  frankly it ' s time switzerland start holding accountable those that dare undermine switzerland and its people .  .  . 
__label__1 i never said the vote was illegitimate--- you did .  stop misrepresenting my views .  i am interested in understanding the dynamics behind protectionist referendums such as capping executive pay ,  limiting talented immigrants and setting out-sized minimum wage .  i simply would like to know if this is a trend and if so is it really a good idea that such a low % of the electorate can move an entire country in a certain direction . 
__label__1 @andreas ,  you are right .  therein lies the dilemma  ( and ,  hence ,  the complexity of this vote )  .  it is not a single issue vote  ( like ,  should we pay for a new highway or new military jets )  .  the vote has broad ramifications for the swiss economy and how global partners and investors view ch .  if more of these emotional votes are coming ,  we will be in for a unique roller coaster ride as some choose to gamble the fate of the entire country for a perceived "return to the past" .  most of those who don ' t care about the broad ramifications are those who have nothing to lose as they are probably at the margins of society already .  what they don ' t realize is that they can ' t rob peter  ( the affluent )  to pay paul  ( the middle and lower class )  .  one way or another ,  ch will suffer overall ,  especially if major trading partners adopt the same protectionist policies .  the simplistic argument that ch was fine before eu free movement is just overly simplistic -- that was a different time and we cannot turn back the clock  ( although it all sounds rather nostalgic and appealing to the masses )  .  whereas quotas per se are not a bad idea for such a small country ,  the referendum does not isolate this as the matter to be "fixed" .  seems ch got itself into a pickle with the "package" it negotiated with the eu . 
__label__1 get a grip ,  ef .  further down ,  you shout: "do not and i repeat do not claim to know my thoughts on working class people or anything else .  .  . " yet here you feel free to make assumptions and extropolate on the comments of others .  if you want to convince others ,  try respectful ,  well-crafted arguments instead of hypocritical hyperventilation . 
__label__0 what *exactly* is the fault of the people ?  that switzerland has some of the lowest unemployment rates in europe ?  that we have a sound currency ?  that we have a stable government ?  that we prefer to retain our sovereignty ,  rather than hand control over to brussels ?  that we are not in debt up to our eyeballs like so many european countries ?  that we have a high standard of living ?  that we don ' t want to see every last square inch of the country paved over to accomodate unbridled immigration ,  just to please the gods of everlasting trade expansion ?  and who are you to judge other people ' s intelligence ? 
__label__0 and there is very little doubt if the american were asked to adopt the initiative and referendum system federally they would say yes by a staggering 3:1 margin .  in fact ,  there is vast empirical evidence to show states with ballot initiatives have "vastly" higher levels of political equality and less corruption the easier it is to put a measure on the ballot .  of course ,  you have those who complain about "tyranny of the majority" .  to which i say: people are going to disagree about what constitutes the good life ,  the problem is tyranny of the minority ,  not the majority ,  and there is a simple solution to the problem: just make any referendum to change the constitutional need support in two elections in a row ,  spaced four years apart ,  plus ,  a certain super-majority of the states  ( two-thirds will do )  .  ps - not much point of direct democracy if judges can strike down laws - hence why dd on a state level is worse than useless . 
__label__1 where do you get your 3:1 margin for american voters with regards to adopting an " .  .  . initiative and referendum" system ?  ?  ?  ?  sounds like pure speculation .  this article is about ch yet you live in australia (  ?  )  and are talking about the us ?  ?  ?  ?  there is no one "best" system .  it really depends on the context and in this case the context is ch .  do you live here ?  do you vote ?  do you understand the dynamics of the country ? 
__label__1 heobviously does not beilieve in human rights .  .  . 
__label__0 the arrogance of mr gauck is staggering .  the swiss are too stupid to make decisions for themselves .  .  . they need politicians  ( such as himself of course !  )  to know what ' s good for them .  i put it to you mr gauck ,  the eu would not be in the mess it is if the people would have more of a say .  hurrah for direct democracy ! 
__label__1 @doug: you are giving yourself away ,  dear .  no real swiss would write using terms like ballistic and balderdash .  perhaps ,  like most of those commenting her ,  you are an immigrant from lower or middle class britain / america .  you kiss the a*s of the swiss so you can stay here .  you left where you came from because you were nothing special .  the swiss like people like you who come here and use anti-us / uk rhetoric in order to prostitute themselves for higher wages .  the irony is that people like you are exactly the ones who are leeching off the swiss system and my taxes .  you send your kids to schools in ch  ( better than the schools back in the crummy part of england or the us from which you hail )  .  you are not a part of the we .  you are a foreigner .  i am a part of the we  ( married to a swiss ,  investments here but without the brainwashing as i am not economically dependent on a job from the swiss )  .  what swiss are you talking about as the we ?  those living in the rural enclave you left england for ? 
__label__0 what a shame that switzerland still practices the sadistic culture of not genuinely helping it ' s patriots and poor alike who need social and economic stability ,  i feel sorry for both those who have hit rock bottom in their lives as well for those who claim to help rock bottom individuals what shame really for a country like switzerland to be so degrading to people who have suffered a great losses in their lives ,  on behalf of my forefathers i apologize to my patriots who are being subjected to social and economic repression by new members of our country for seeing one repressed swiss or non swiss in switzerland makes me sick for such behavior is not a swiss attitude .  .  . 
__label__1 you have no evidence whether i do ,  or do not ,  or could ,  live or invest in ch .  and ,  again ,  that is irrelevant to your extravagant claim that the vote was somehow illegitimate .  by this measure ,  every parliamentary vote ,  ever ,  would also be illegitimate as it consists of less than 0 . 005 percent of the population .  also systems have "risks" - but whether the "risks" are worth it boils down to policy preferences .  that is the point .  in the absent of any self-evident universally agreed upon criteria to resolve disagreement ,  we need some form of aggregation device .  democracy is one such device . 
__label__1 so it ' s going to be a little tough .  such is life !  it ' s best to get on with it and cut the rhetoric .  the eu needs switzerland as well . 
__label__0 oh ,  you are actually not swiss and probably not affluent .  you are one of those wage-shopping foreigners who came here to earn higher wages than you could get back in your home country ?  now ,  you want to pretend to be swiss when people like you  ( lower and middle income earners from other countries in the west )  are exactly those who are putting a burden on the swiss system .  you put your kids in public schools which are better than those in your home country ,  you earn higher wages than you would back home ,  and you bend over backwards to convince the swiss that you belong here because you are afraid to go back home to the crappy life you had with your low education ? 
__label__1 @doug: you are showing your bias .  what is so respectful about the plethora of anti-us and anti-eu comments on this website ?  most who comment are so biased all they can do is state an opinion without facts .  i can live anywhere in the world---- so ,  i don ' t need to show bias to the swiss cows ,  the yanks ,  or anybody else .  how many can claim to have that degree of objectivity ?  and ,  by the way ,  i am not trying to "convince" others of my arguments as you postulate .  that would be easy .  all i have to do is restate the typical swiss propaganda and i will have lots of "friends" .  it ' s too bad that having a real exchange of ideas isn ' t easy since 90%+ of those posting are simply stating their opinion like they are filling out a survey . 
__label__0 it has nothing to do with xenophobia .  .  . switzerland cannot accommodate the large influx of people .  that ' s it and nothing more .  the vote was correct .  everyone wants it "easy" these days .  thing will have to be changed now and there ' s nothing wrong with that .  in the end ,  all will see that the vote was the best thing for switzerland .  i will take quality over quantity any day ! 
__label__0 guts ?  i think he lacks brains - gauck should not try to infer that politicians are smarter than the muppets who vote them in .  .  .  . eh ,  perhaps you are right .  .  . 
__label__1 i am simply basing my views on your comments and policy preferences ,  and looking at their policy implications .  i conclude that you have little or no sympathy the middle ,  working class - and prefer oligarchy instead .  a few affluent elites versus a few serfs from who knows where .  i note i do not discuss religion ,  sex ,  left / right divide too much ,  but i do occasionally mention class .  so given i am tolerating you mentioning differences in class ,  i am happy to discuss the oligarchic implications flowing from your policy preferences .  i also note your did not contradict the data or statistics i cited . 
__label__1 the arrogance of mr gauck is staggering .  the swiss are too stupid to make decisions for themselves .  .  . they need politicians  ( such as himself of course !  )  to know what ' s good for them .  i put it to you mr gauck ,  the eu would not be in the mess it is if the people would have more of a say .  hurrah for direct democracy ! 
__label__1 german president joachim gauck has criticised the swiss system of direct democracy ,  calling it “dangerous when citizens vote on highly complex issues” in reference to the decision by the swiss in february to curb immigration .  translates to the people are to stupid to know what to understand anything .  they need to be told what to think by people just like me
__label__1 i don ' t have much interest in reading posts from those who don ' t actually live / invest in ch .  if you don ' t have to suffer the consequences of the vote ,  then your opinion doesn ' t matter much .  also ,  if you know so much about direct democracy then you might know that there are risks too .  and the risks in ch are unique to ch and it ' s population and economics . 
__label__1 unlike most who are posting here ,  i am not focused on this one vote but on the broader implications for voting in general .  after the vote ,  blocher actually said " .  .  . the french aren ' t real swiss" .  one thing about this vote is we can see the type of people behind it and their agenda--- using fear and anti-foreigner propaganda to fire up voters is dangerous .  if this is all it takes to pass a referendum in ch ,  then that is truly frightening . 
__label__1 a tactic you are using now the scare mongering  ,  oh those unscrupulous right wingers when will they ever get it right ,  cut them a little slack to allow robust debate we are all big boys n girls now able to see beyond a typo or verbal gaff geez ef lift your game
__label__1 eu ' s so called free movement of people procures a modern form of enslavement of minorities ,  there is not as single person in the eu who has legitimate equal rights in the so called free movement of europeans who are members of this so called "human right privilege" of the eu ,  fact is that the eu is a communist organization living of the efforts of free trade global capitalism .  .  .  switzerland has done a great job at saying no to human rights abuses ,  switzerland has great incentives in making equatable opportunities from third world countries that in turn will prevent unhealthy migration and it will help develop communities in dire need of economic stimulus ,  this is yet another example to the rest of the world how healthy democracy looks like ,  bravo schweiz ,  greed is expensive and has no value in a satisfied population .  .  . 
__label__1 your comments make a lot of sense and i fully subscribe to them .  you are also right about the comments of commentator “ef” - it is indeed a waste of time to answer someone who does not want to hear factual or rational arguments .  .  . 
__label__1 in a contest between keeping the bilateral agreements and limiting immigration ,  i would be forced to choose the bi-lateral agreements .  we won ' t have both .  i don ' t think people realise how important these are to the swiss economy today  ( and on what good terms we had them - seeing as we are neither eu or eea )  .  these and free movement are especially important to the swiss youth .  immigration & the eu can be dealt with in other ways ,  although the svp doesn ' t want to compromise . 
__label__1 commentator “ef” claims that because only a third or so of the  ( entire possible )  electorate voted on this matter it is illegitimate .  firstly ,  we must remember that parliament consists only of a few hundred people .  hence ,  a parliamentary vote is only 0 . 0005 percent of the electorate ,  perhaps less .  the figure collapses further when we remember that parliamentary quorums can be as low as third of the membership ,  but that does not preclude them from passing legislation .  so the vote is still more widespread and legitimate than any existing alternative .  secondly ,  some voters who would have voted “yes” may have refused to show up because they might say to themselves “oh ,  well ,  everyone says this will fail ,  so why bother voting ? ” others are happy to bind themselves to the view of the 30 percent ,  delegating the duty to those who have an opinion one way or the other .  to be sure ,  others might have not shown up who opposed it because they knew it would fail .  still that is 20 , 000 real human beings we have to find somewhere to “shift” the vote .  thirdly ,  “ef” complains how the germans get their way too much  ( although even in french speaking cantons registered a yes vote well above 40 percent )  .  i say: thank god for germanic efficiency .  my goodness ,  have you seen france lately ?  if french speaking cantons want to join france ,  by all means do so .  i suspect they will not ,  however .  finally ,  if “ef” has a problem ,  s / he can either lobby parliament ,  federal or cantonal ,  to have another vote !  this is all ignoring that the voters approved a broad proposition; it is up to parliament now to ensuring quantity and quality control . 
__label__1 i never said the vote was illegitimate--- you did .  stop misrepresenting my views .  i am interested in understanding the dynamics behind protectionist referendums such as capping executive pay ,  limiting talented immigrants and setting out-sized minimum wage .  i simply would like to know if this is a trend and if so is it really a good idea that such a low % of the electorate can move an entire country in a certain direction . 
__label__1 we are the bullies on the block dear lady !  we are the ones that made the agreements ,  voted on them and now expect we can break them ,  while the other side should continue to uphold them .  what double standards you have !

__label__1 what is there to be sought other than comprehensive action by the responsible authorities in the bundeshaus ,  the majority of them responsible for the now unreasonable and worrisome flood of immigrants over the past decade ,  some of it being an influx of social benefits opportunists and questionable undocumented asylum seekers .  why are facts an conundrum is the question here . 
__label__0 that doesn ' t answer my question . 
__label__1 bravo my butt .  the swiss rebutted the americans because these are "russian" jewish israeli billionaires that swiss banks favor for their deposits .  they are simply pandering to zionist power and corruption .  the swiss are not standing up to american sanctions for justice but defending the zionazi billions . 
__label__0 better than kowtowing to washington - just itching to pull the trigger .  the us needs to experience a war on its territory ,  perhaps then the war mongers would realize what the horrors of war feel and look like .

__label__1 maybe you should take your own advice and 1 )  stop attributing words to me that i did not say and 2 )  actually answer or debate my questions with some reasoned response .  if you can prove that fear wasn ' t part of the voting then show me the proof .  otherwise ,  it is a perfectly possible scenario .  it ' s just too bad we don ' t get any better demographic and other data as to why people vote the way they do .  it seems in ch nobody does much research --- it ' s too bad .  it ' s like the swiss are choosing to be ill-informed .  no data ,  no proof .

__label__1 right
__label__1 the more i read the opinions of those who voted for this referendum ,  the more it becomes obvious just how much xenophobia was behind it .  the vote was cleverly constructed to play on the fear of foreigners that is already so rampant in ch .  to have been an honest effort ,  the referendum should have been about whether to do away with the bi laterals or not .  and before the attacks begin ,  i will disclose that i am not against quotas .

__label__0 bottom line: ch is an unstable and increasingly risky place to do business .  companies and investors can ' t rely on what the govt  ( federal or local )  says because a certain class of society will band together in fear and vote for all kinds of wacky stuff like limiting pay for executives ,  a minimum wage that is 2x that of germany ,  limits on sourcing talented workers ,  etc ,  etc ,  etc .

__label__1 a quick internet search on daniel cohn-bendit reveals a rather unsavoury background .  just the sort of morally bankrupt bureaucrat that switzerland certainly need not take orders from .  i hope cohn-bendit is not holding his breath for switzerland to come crawling back on its knees .  .  . 
__label__1 that ' s as straight as an arrow and every one of those bilateral agreements carries a guillotine clause so it ' s not a renege or a breach of ethics its simply a application of an agreed condition agreed by the brussels people and the bern people ,  oh dear how sad to bad look at the children chucking the mother of all tantrums in brussels (  .  .  .  ) 
__label__0 “the social democrats called on the government to present a report weighing the current policy of bilateral treaties with the eu against the possibility of swiss membership in the 28-nation bloc . ” also heard this today on swiss tv news .  they obviously have still not understood that the majority of swiss citizens would not even think about an eu membership .  some political observers believe that the adhesion to the eec could have passed years ago if the socialists had refrained from their stupid talk about “anti-chamber towards full membership” .  meanwhile the opinion of the population in the romandie  ( who were then rather in favor )  has changed towards a clear no .

__label__0 swiss people are generally very kind and trusting .  as such ,  these types of religious centers are supported by many people .  i would urge the committees to look at uk or us where such centers are managed and monitored for undesirables who abuse such centers to fuel hatred for non-muslims and may even grow the wrong kind of ideology from a peaceful country like switzerland .  leaving the border offices closed after 1900hrs is the kind of "trust"  ( or laziness )  which swiss border police do .  i fear such trust in building a center for muslims or christians or any religion must be closely monitored by a more zealous policing department .  don ' t restrict them but also don ' t just let them do everything hidden in the mosques .
